A banana is a curved, elongated fruit with soft, creamy flesh enclosed in a
thick yellow peel. Bananas grow in clusters called hands on large herbaceous
plants of the genus Musa. The fruit is rich in potassium, dietary fiber, and
natural sugars, making it a popular and nutritious snack. Bananas are typically
harvested while still green and ripen to yellow as starches convert to sugars.
They can be eaten raw, blended into smoothies, baked into bread, or used in
various desserts and savory dishes around the world.
