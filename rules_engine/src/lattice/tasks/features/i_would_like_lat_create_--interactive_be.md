I would like `lat create --interactive` to be able to select previous input paths via the arrow keys (e.g. press up to get a previous parent path, press down to go forward in history). Please persist this history in the .lattice directory. Please ensure the tab complete for paths and enter key to reuse the previous path all still work.
