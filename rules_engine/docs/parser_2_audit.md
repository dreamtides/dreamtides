# Predicate Parsing

# Effect Parsing

30. **Code Quality - Duplicate cost parsers in effect_parser**:
    `pay_energy_cost()` (effect_parser.rs:277), `discard_cost()` (line 281), and
    `abandon_cost()` (line 290) duplicate similar parsers already defined in
    cost_parser.rs. When these trigger costs are used in
    effect_with_trigger_cost_parser(), the parsing logic is maintained in two
    places, creating inconsistency risk if cost parsing rules change.

34. **Generality - Hardcoded "each ally" in trigger judgment**:
    `trigger_judgment_ability()` (game_effects_parsers.rs:308-317) hardcodes
    both the word sequence "trigger the {judgment} ability of each ally" and the
    result fields `matching: Predicate::Another(CardPredicate::Character)` and
    `collection: CollectionExpression::All`. The "each ally" portion should be
    parsed as a general predicate to support variations like "trigger the
    {judgment} ability of each {subtype}" or "trigger the {judgment} ability of
    each allied character with cost {e} or less".
