# V2 Deckbuilder Critique: The Deckbuilder's Eye

## Methodology

For each archetype, I assume a ~30-card deck target and analyze from the perspective of a player who has already committed to the archetype. How many slots are genuinely flexible? Can you build meaningfully different versions? Where are the real decisions?

I define:
- **Auto-include**: A card so obviously correct that including it requires zero thought. More auto-includes = less interesting deckbuilding.
- **Flex slot**: A slot where 2+ reasonable options compete and the choice depends on your specific build, metagame read, or personal style.
- **Build diversity**: Whether you can construct 2+ meaningfully different decks within the same archetype.

---

## Archetype-by-Archetype Analysis

---

### 1. MIRAGE (Tide + Zephyr) -- Blink/Flicker

**Flex Slot Count: ~10-12 of 30**

Mirage has a tight core engine (7 flicker enablers are essentially mandatory: Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer, Starlight Guide, Aurora Rider, Passage Through Oblivion, Portal of Twin Paths, Dimensional Pathfinder). Add 3-4 Materialized-value targets (Frost Visionary, Looming Oracle, Keeper of Forgotten Light) and 3-4 materialize-matters payoffs (Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer, Tideborne Voyager), plus Starlit Cascade and Call to the Unknown, and you have ~18-20 locked slots. That leaves 10-12 genuinely flexible slots.

**Build Diversity: HIGH (3 distinct builds)**

1. **Tempo Mirage** -- Lean on cheap flicker targets (Frost Visionary, Looming Oracle, Tranquil Duelist) with bounce effects (Nomad of Endless Paths, Return to Nowhere, Key to the Moment). Low curve, high churn. Wins through accumulating card advantage while bouncing threats.
2. **Big Mirage** -- Cosmic Puppeteer, Keeper of Forgotten Light, Aurora Channeler as high-end targets. Ramps with Angel of the Eclipse and Starlit Cascade to flicker expensive targets for devastating swings. Plays closer to a midrange/control deck.
3. **Go-Wide Mirage** -- Radiant Trio, Endless Projection, Mirrorlight Architect as core cards. Materialize as many bodies as possible; The Bondweaver and Lumin-Gate Seer turn each materialization into value. Plays more like a board-flood strategy.

**Key Decisions:**
- How many flicker enablers vs. targets? Too many enablers without good targets = wasted flickering. Too many targets without enablers = a pile of mediocre Materialized: Draw 1 bodies.
- Cosmic Puppeteer vs. Wraith of Twisting Shadows: Do you want repeatable theft or repeatable hand disruption? The 5-cost slot is tight.
- Starlit Cascade vs. Aurora Channeler as energy engine: Cascade is more explosive on big flicker turns but requires setup; Channeler is steady but 4-cost and only works when flickered.
- How much splash protection (Voidshield Guardian) vs. more proactive cards?

**Auto-includes: ~8** (Flickerveil Adept, Frost Visionary, Starlit Cascade, Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, Passage Through Oblivion, Call to the Unknown, Shimmer Step)

**Verdict: Strong deckbuilding space.** The three build variants are genuinely different, and the tension between tempo/big/wide creates real decisions.

---

### 2. UNDERTOW (Tide + Ruin) -- Self-Mill / Survivor Tribal

**Flex Slot Count: ~8-10 of 30**

Undertow has a large mandatory core: the self-mill package (Flagbearer of Decay, Searcher in the Mists, Harvest the Forgotten, Ashborn Necromancer), the void-size payoffs (Abomination of Memory, Weight of Memory, Architect of Memory), and the Survivor tribal package (Soulkindler, Hope's Vanguard, Kindred Sparks, Veil of the Wastes, Through the Rift, Seer of the Fallen, Silent Avenger, Twilight Reclaimer). That is 15 core + ~5-6 strong cards = ~20 locked slots.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE (2 distinct builds)**

1. **Tribal-Dense Undertow** -- Max Survivor density. Soulkindler, Kindred Sparks, Veil of the Wastes, Hope's Vanguard form a self-sustaining Survivor recursion loop. Every Survivor body matters. Plays like a tribal aggro-midrange deck that happens to use the void.
2. **Void-Volume Undertow** -- Focuses on Abomination of Memory, Architect of Memory, Weight of Memory as the payoff layer. Runs more self-mill (Ashborn Necromancer, both Searchers), less Survivor tribal. Aims for void count 8+ and plays a bigger, slower game with more generic draw (Knowledge Restored, Reunion).

**Key Decisions:**
- Survivor density vs. generically powerful cards: Do you run Emberwatch Veteran (a mediocre Survivor body) for tribal density, or Knowledge Restored (generic but powerful draw)?
- Architect of Memory: This card is contested 3-way. If you get it, your deck tilts toward void-volume. If you don't, you lean harder on Survivor tribal recursion loops.
- How much draw to run: Aggressive self-mill risks decking. Knowledge Restored, Reunion, and Guiding Light prevent this but dilute the Survivor count.
- Path to Redemption: At 6 energy, is it too slow for your build? The Tribal-Dense version may not want it; the Void-Volume version considers it essential.

**Auto-includes: ~12** (Flagbearer of Decay, Searcher in the Mists, Harvest the Forgotten, Abomination of Memory, Weight of Memory, Soulkindler, Hope's Vanguard, Kindred Sparks, Veil of the Wastes, Through the Rift, Seer of the Fallen, Twilight Reclaimer)

**Verdict: Decent but somewhat constrained.** The two builds are real but overlap heavily. The 12 auto-includes are the highest count of any archetype, which signals that the Survivor tribal package is so synergistic that you always jam all of it. The interesting decisions are mostly at the margins -- which 8-10 flex slots to fill.

---

### 3. BASALT (Zephyr + Stone) -- Ramp / Spirit Animal Tribal

**Flex Slot Count: ~8-10 of 30**

Basalt's core is locked: 6 Spirit Animal energy generators (Ghostlight Wolves, Luminwings, Spirit of the Greenwood, Dawnprowler Panther, Driftcaller Sovereign, Emerald Guardian), 5-6 tribal lords/payoffs (Spiritbound Alpha, Sunshadow Eagle, Eternal Stag, Spirit Bond, Mystic Runefish, Seeker of the Radiant Wilds), and 3 engine pieces (Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, Verdant Packmother). That is ~14-15 locked cards. Add 3-4 materialize-matters bridge cards (Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer) = ~18-19 locked.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE-HIGH (2-3 builds)**

1. **Pure Tribal Basalt** -- Max Spirit Animal density. Every slot is a Spirit Animal. Spiritbound Alpha and Mystic Runefish as finishers. Spirit Bond as the nuclear option. Plays like a tribal deck with enormous burst potential.
2. **Materialize-Engine Basalt** -- Leans into Conduit of Resonance / Blazing Emberwing as the engine. Runs flicker effects (Blooming Path Wanderer, Flickerveil Adept) borrowed from Mirage. Materialize triggers collapse Judgment abilities into every deployment. More combo-oriented.
3. **Big Ramp Basalt** -- Nexus Wayfinder, Surge of Fury, Light of Emergence. Uses Spirit Animals primarily as ramp infrastructure, deploying expensive non-tribal finishers (Dreamborne Leviathan, or even splashed cards). Less tribal, more "green ramp."

**Key Decisions:**
- Spirit Bond vs. Mystic Runefish: Both are finishers but want different board states. Spirit Bond wants 5+ Spirit Animals; Runefish wants to set all to 5 spark, which is better when you have fewer, larger animals. You probably can't run both.
- How many materialize-matters cards to include: Angel of the Eclipse and The Bondweaver are shared with Mirage. If Mirage is open, they are contested picks. How much of the shared bridge cluster do you draft?
- Light of Emergence: 5-cost to materialize 2 random cost-3-or-less from deck. Incredible when it hits Spirit Animals, dead when it misses. Your Spirit Animal density determines whether this is auto-include or unplayable.
- Surge of Fury: Extra Judgment phase is enormous with Ghostlight Wolves and Spirit of the Greenwood out. But it costs a card slot for a 1-cost event that does nothing without a board. How much setup is too much?

**Auto-includes: ~10** (Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, Verdant Packmother, Ghostlight Wolves, Dawnprowler Panther, Eternal Stag, Sunshadow Eagle, Angel of the Eclipse, Lumin-Gate Seer, Spiritbound Alpha)

**Verdict: Solid deckbuilding space.** The tension between tribal density and engine optimization creates real decisions. The three builds play differently enough to matter. The shared Mirage bridge (materialize-matters cluster) creates interesting draft tension.

---

### 4. CRUCIBLE (Stone + Ember) -- Warrior Tribal / Lords

**Flex Slot Count: ~6-8 of 30**

Crucible has the most locked-in core of any archetype. The 4 Warrior lords (Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity, Company Commander, Assault Leader) are mandatory. The 3 tribal infrastructure pieces (Seeker for the Way, Summons of the Bonded, Invoker of Myths) are mandatory. The 3 ramp Warriors (Wolfbond Chieftain, Dawnblade Wanderer, Ethereal Trailblazer) are mandatory. The 3 Warrior-specific removal cards (Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade, Ride of the Vanguard) are mandatory. Add Aspiring Guardian, Bloomweaver, Blade of Unity, Skyflame Commander, Surge of Fury, Spirit Field Reclaimer = ~20-22 locked slots.

**Build Diversity: LOW-MODERATE (2 builds, but they overlap heavily)**

1. **Pure Lords Crucible** -- Max Warrior density. Every card is either a Warrior or cares about Warriors. Blade of Unity, Company Commander, and Skyflame Commander form the lord trifecta. Wins by going wide with buffed Warriors.
2. **Warrior-Sacrifice Crucible** -- Leans into the Cinder bridge: Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, The Dread Sovereign, Grim Reclaimer, Blade of Oblivion. Uses sacrifice outlets to generate value while still benefiting from Warrior tribal density. Less lord-reliant, more engine-oriented.

**Key Decisions:**
- How deep into the sacrifice bridge: Forsworn Champion and Dreadcall Warden are strong Warrior bodies regardless of sacrifice. But Blade of Oblivion and Grim Reclaimer are worse without sacrifice targets. Do you commit to the sub-theme?
- The Dread Sovereign: This card is genuinely fascinating in Crucible. It abandons a Warrior to discover a higher-cost one. This creates a sacrifice engine WITHIN the tribal deck. But it requires Warriors at multiple cost points, which may conflict with the "go wide with cheap lords" plan.
- Speaker for the Forgotten: At 5-cost, this Mage bridges to Bedrock (Reclaim). Do you include a non-Warrior that cares about Warriors, knowing it dilutes Blade of Unity's count?
- Frost Visionary: A Warrior body that Mirage really wants. Do you take it for density, or let Mirage have it and play another Warrior instead?

**Auto-includes: ~16** (Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity, Company Commander, Assault Leader, Seeker for the Way, Summons of the Bonded, Invoker of Myths, Wolfbond Chieftain, Dawnblade Wanderer, Ethereal Trailblazer, Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade, Ride of the Vanguard, Aspiring Guardian, Bloomweaver, Surge of Fury)

**Verdict: Weakest deckbuilding space.** Crucible's 16 auto-includes leave only 6-8 flex slots, and most of those are filled by the Warrior-sacrifice bridge cards that are all individually powerful enough to include without much thought. The archetype plays itself -- you draft Warriors, you play Warriors. The Dread Sovereign is the one card that creates a genuinely interesting decision point.

---

### 5. CINDER (Ember + Ruin) -- Aristocrats / Sacrifice / Abandon

**Flex Slot Count: ~10-12 of 30**

Cinder's core abandon payoffs (Harvester of Despair, Infernal Ascendant, Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker, Shardwoven Tyrant, Blade of Oblivion) plus abandon enablers (Spirit Reaping, Obliterator of Worlds, Soulbinder, Desperation) plus dissolved triggers (Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning, Volcanic Channeler, Sunset Chronicler, Dustborn Veteran) = ~14-15 locked. Add signpost (Exiles of the Last Light) + removal (Momentum of the Fallen, Unleashed Destruction) + tutor (Rite of Summoning) = ~18-20 locked.

**Build Diversity: HIGH (3 builds)**

1. **Kindle Cinder** -- Focuses on Mother of Flames (if splashed from Eclipse), Infernal Ascendant, Exiles of the Last Light, and Emberwatch Veteran. Every sacrifice generates kindle, building permanent spark. Wants lots of cheap fodder (Aspiring Guardian, Nightmare Manifest) and fewer expensive sacrifice payoffs.
2. **Point-Scoring Cinder** -- Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker, Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning as the engine. Every sacrifice converts to points. Less interested in spark, more interested in the sacrifice loop being an alternate win condition. Can win through abandon-to-points without needing big spark boards.
3. **Control Cinder** -- Shardwoven Tyrant, Obliterator of Worlds, Blade of Oblivion, Momentum of the Fallen as the core. Uses sacrifice as removal. Plays more defensively, clearing the opponent's board through sacrifice-gated removal while grinding with recursion.

**Key Decisions:**
- Cheap sacrifice fodder vs. expensive payoffs: Nightmare Manifest (1-cost, forces symmetrical sacrifice) is incredible in Cinder but demands you have more board than the opponent. How many 0-1 cost bodies do you run vs. 4-5 cost payoffs?
- Resilient Wanderer: The dream sacrifice loop piece (Dissolved: pay 1 to return to hand). But it is contested by Undertow. If you get it, your sacrifice engine becomes much smoother. If not, you need more one-shot recursion.
- Starlit Cascade: Mirage's signature card, but in Cinder it reads "when an ally leaves play [through sacrifice], gain 2 energy." Potentially game-breaking in Cinder on a big sacrifice turn. But it is Tide-coded, making it a splash pick.
- The Rising God: 9 cost, 6 spark, Abandon 2: Reclaim. In Cinder, each Reclaim cycle generates 2 abandon triggers. But 9 cost is enormous even with Spirit Reaping's energy conversion. How top-heavy can the deck be?

**Auto-includes: ~10** (Harvester of Despair, Infernal Ascendant, The Forsaker, Shardwoven Tyrant, Spirit Reaping, Obliterator of Worlds, Desperation, Exiles of the Last Light, Momentum of the Fallen, Rite of Summoning)

**Verdict: Excellent deckbuilding space.** Three genuinely different builds, 10-12 flex slots, and the kindle/points/control axis creates meaningful decisions. The sacrifice loop has natural tension between "how many payoffs" and "how many bodies to sacrifice," which is a classic engine-building puzzle.

---

### 6. TEMPEST (Tide + Ember) -- Spellslinger / Storm

**Flex Slot Count: ~8-10 of 30**

The storm engine is fairly locked: 3 cards-played payoffs (Illumination of Glory, Echoes of the Journey, Packcaller of Shadows), 4 event copying (Echo Architect, Cascade of Reflections, Echoes of Eternity, The Ringleader), 4 energy burst (Genesis Burst, Flash of Power, Catalyst Ignition, Arc Gate Opening), draw doubling (The Power Within), event tutor (Door to Possibility), cost reduction (Starcatcher, Keeper of the Lightpath) = ~16 locked. Add the new signposts (Resonance Spark, Storm Conduit, Volatile Inscription, Leyline Detonation) and you have ~20 locked.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE (2 builds)**

1. **Big Storm Tempest** -- All-in on one massive turn. Genesis Burst, Flash of Power, Catalyst Ignition, Echoes of Eternity, The Ringleader, Illumination of Glory. Assembles combo pieces, then detonates with event copying + energy multiplication into a single lethal turn. Moment Rewound as a backup.
2. **Chain Tempest** -- Less about one huge turn, more about consistent event chaining. Resonance Spark, Arcane Refraction, Data Pulse, Guiding Light as cheap chain links. Oracle of Shifting Skies and Spirit of Smoldering Echoes as incremental payoffs. Plays more like a "value storm" deck that generates advantage each turn rather than going for a single kill turn.

**Key Decisions:**
- Moment Rewound vs. more chain pieces: The extra turn is a legendary finisher but costs 3 energy and a card slot. Is your deck consistent enough to use it, or would another cheap cantrip be better?
- The Calling Night: Draw 1 per Judgment, but opponent gains 2 points. In a slow-building storm deck, this generates 3-5 cards over the game. But the point cost creates a clock. Interesting risk/reward decision.
- Celestial Reverie: "When you play a character, draw 1" -- in Tempest, characters are uncommon. Is this worth a slot for the 2-3 characters you do play, or is it dead weight?
- How much removal to include: Unleash Ruin, Scorched Reckoning, and Momentum of the Fallen are events (so they count for storm) and removal (so they protect you while assembling). But they are expensive and dilute the chain.

**Auto-includes: ~12** (Illumination of Glory, Echoes of the Journey, Echo Architect, Cascade of Reflections, Genesis Burst, Flash of Power, Catalyst Ignition, Starcatcher, Keeper of the Lightpath, Door to Possibility, The Power Within, Resonance Spark)

**Verdict: Decent but narrower than it appears.** The 12 auto-includes and the linear nature of "play events, chain events, win" means most Tempest decks look similar. The Big Storm vs. Chain Storm distinction is real but subtle -- both are still "play lots of events." The flex slots are mostly about tuning the ratio of cheap cantrips to expensive payoffs.

---

### 7. DEPTHS (Tide + Stone) -- Control

**Flex Slot Count: ~10-12 of 30**

Depths has a mandatory Prevent suite (9 cards), hand disruption (3 cards: Break the Veil, Lurking Dread, Wraith of Twisting Shadows), and control bodies (4-5 cards: Cloaked Sentinel, Pallid Arbiter, Voidshield Guardian, Paradox Enforcer, Riftwalker). That is ~16-17 locked. Add ramp (Virtuoso of Harmony, Nexus Wayfinder) and finishers (Keeper of Forgotten Light, The Waking Titan) = ~20 locked.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE-HIGH (2-3 builds)**

1. **Hard Control Depths** -- All 9 Prevents, maximum disruption. Break the Veil, Lurking Dread for hand attack. Paradox Enforcer and Riftwalker for permanent/temporary removal. Keeper of Forgotten Light as the inevitability finisher. Plays the classic draw-go control game.
2. **Ramp Control Depths** -- Fewer Prevents (maybe 5-6), more ramp (Virtuoso of Harmony, Nexus Wayfinder, Emerald Guardian, Dawnblade Wanderer). Deploys The Waking Titan faster and uses resource dominance rather than permission to win. Less reactive, more proactive.
3. **Tax Depths** -- Cloaked Sentinel ("opponent's events cost 1 more"), Pallid Arbiter ("disable Materialized abilities"), Tidestone Arbiter ("opponent's characters cost 1 more"). Taxes the opponent rather than countering them directly. Supplemented by a few Prevents as backup.

**Key Decisions:**
- How many Prevents to run: 9 is available, but running all 9 means your deck is almost pure reaction. Most control decks want 5-7 Prevents and fill the rest with ramp/finishers. Which Prevents to cut? Maelstrom Denial (narrow: only fast cards) and Together Against the Tide (narrow: only dissolve events) are the first cuts, but even cutting 2-3 creates a meaningful choice.
- Fell the Mighty: Ember-coded, requires banishing from hand to play for free. In Depths, you have cards to spare. But it is a splash pick outside your resonances. Worth the off-color slot?
- Keeper of Forgotten Light vs. The Waking Titan as your primary finisher: KoFL draws 2 on entry but costs 6; Waking Titan draws every Judgment and bounces an ally (synergy with ramp bodies) but costs 5 and requires returning a 3+ cost ally. Different finisher philosophies.
- Apocalypse: 6-cost board wipe. In Depths, you likely have fewer creatures than the opponent. But it dissolves YOUR finishers too. Is the reset worth it?

**Auto-includes: ~8** (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Cragfall, Threadbreaker, Wraith of Twisting Shadows, Paradox Enforcer, Virtuoso of Harmony, Tidestone Arbiter)

**Verdict: Strong deckbuilding space.** The 3 viable builds (permission, ramp, tax) create genuinely different play patterns. The Prevent suite density creates an interesting "how many answers vs. how much proactive development?" tension that is the hallmark of good control deck construction. The 8 auto-includes are relatively low for a tribal-adjacent archetype.

---

### 8. GALE (Zephyr + Ember) -- Flash / Fast Tempo

**Flex Slot Count: ~8-10 of 30**

Gale's core: 6 fast-matters payoffs (Sage of the Prelude, Intermezzo Balladeer, Melodist of the Finale, Moonlit Dancer, Sundown Surfer, Keeper of the Tides), 5 fast removal (Immolate, Shatter the Frail, Pyrokinetic Surge, Fell the Mighty, Shattering Gambit), and signpost (Tempest Striker) = 12 locked. Add strong fast characters (Nomad of Endless Paths, Abyssal Enforcer, Astral Navigators, Synaptic Sentinel, Herald of the Last Light) = ~17 locked.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE (2 builds)**

1. **Musician Gale** -- All-in on the Musician trio (Sage draws, Balladeer grows, Melodist scores). Every card in the deck should be fast or enable fast play. Moonlit Dancer is the centerpiece, making hand characters fast. Plays like a combo-tempo deck where each fast card triggers 3 different payoffs.
2. **Aggressive Gale** -- Less reliant on Musicians, more on raw fast bodies and removal. Abyssal Enforcer bounces threats, Herald of the Last Light counters events, Wasteland Arbitrator disrupts. Wins through tempo advantage -- deploy on opponent's turn, remove on your turn, Judgment for points.

**Key Decisions:**
- Minstrel of Falling Light: A Musician that is NOT fast. It triggers the Musician tribe but does not trigger fast-matters payoffs. Is the 2/2 body with draw ability worth a slot, or does the non-fast clash with the deck's identity?
- How much Prevent to splash: Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, and Infernal Rest are all fast events that trigger Musician payoffs. But they are Tide-coded (off-resonance). Running 2-3 Prevents turns Gale into a hybrid tempo-control deck. Is that better than more aggression?
- Starlit Cascade: "When ally leaves play, gain 2 energy." With Nomad of Endless Paths bouncing allies and Abyssal Enforcer being re-deployed, this generates a lot of energy. But it requires setup. Worth a slot?
- Dreamscatter and Secrets of the Deep: Both are fast draw that triggers Musicians. But Dreamscatter costs energy to draw, and Secrets forces 2 discards. Which is better in a tempo-focused deck?

**Auto-includes: ~10** (Sage of the Prelude, Intermezzo Balladeer, Melodist of the Finale, Moonlit Dancer, Sundown Surfer, Keeper of the Tides, Tempest Striker, Immolate, Fell the Mighty, Pyrokinetic Surge)

**Verdict: Moderate deckbuilding space.** The Musician core is so powerful that almost every Gale deck centers on it. The Aggressive vs. Musician distinction is real but the Musician version is almost always better (the payoffs are too strong to skip). The flex slots are mostly about supporting card selection and whether to splash Prevents.

---

### 9. ECLIPSE (Zephyr + Ruin) -- Self-Discard Payoffs

**Flex Slot Count: ~12-14 of 30**

Eclipse has the thinnest core payoff layer: 5 discard payoffs (Mother of Flames, Apocalypse Vigilante, Torchbearer of the Abyss, Forgotten Titan, Ashmaze Guide), 4 core enablers (Fragments of Vision, Skies of Change, Chronicle Reclaimer, Nocturne), and 2 signposts (Ridge Vortex Explorer, Voidweave Dancer) = 11 locked. Add Pattern Seeker and Memory Unraveler = ~13. That leaves 17 slots, but you need ~4-5 more enablers to have enough discard density, leaving ~12-14 genuinely flexible.

**Build Diversity: HIGH (3 builds)**

1. **Kindle Eclipse** -- Mother of Flames, Torchbearer of the Abyss, Emberwatch Veteran as the core payoff. Every discard generates kindle, building permanent spark. The discard enablers (Fragments of Vision, Skies of Change) are the engine. Wins through spark accumulation.
2. **Points Eclipse** -- Apocalypse Vigilante as the centerpiece: every discard = 1 point. Pattern Seeker adds another point per discard. Less spark-oriented, more direct scoring. Wants maximum discard volume per turn.
3. **Recursion Eclipse** -- Ashmaze Guide and Architect of Memory as the engine. Discarding expensive cards gives them Reclaim, creating a loop: discard -> void -> Reclaim -> hand -> discard. Less aggressive, more value-oriented. Plays a longer game.

**Key Decisions:**
- How many discard enablers is enough? Too few = payoffs sit idle. Too many = hand always empty with no payoffs online. The balance point is the core deckbuilding decision.
- Architect of Memory: Contested 3-way (Undertow/Eclipse/Bedrock). If you get it, Recursion Eclipse becomes very powerful. If not, you lean into kindle or points.
- Urban Cipher: 4-cost, 3 spark, Materialized: Discard 2, Draw 2. Two discard triggers on a strong body. But 4 cost is expensive for an enabler. Do you prioritize the body or run another cheap enabler?
- Rebirth Ritualist: Abandon a character + discard hand = draw 3. The hand discard is 3-5 payoff triggers, but losing your board AND hand is devastating. Is the payoff worth the setup cost?
- How much generic Reclaim support: Path to Redemption (6-cost, mass Reclaim) and Whisper of the Past (3-cost, targeted event Reclaim) are powerful recursion but not discard-specific. Do they strengthen Eclipse's engine or dilute it?

**Auto-includes: ~6** (Mother of Flames, Apocalypse Vigilante, Ashmaze Guide, Fragments of Vision, Voidweave Dancer, Ridge Vortex Explorer)

**Verdict: Excellent deckbuilding space despite thin payoff layer.** Eclipse has the fewest auto-includes (6) and the most flex slots (12-14) of any archetype. This is a double-edged sword -- it means high decision density but also that the archetype is harder to build correctly. The three build variants are genuinely different. The low auto-include count means Eclipse drafters face more meaningful decisions per pick than any other archetype.

---

### 10. BEDROCK (Stone + Ruin) -- Reanimator / Cheat Into Play

**Flex Slot Count: ~8-10 of 30**

Bedrock has a tight core: reanimation targets (Titan of Forgotten Echoes, The Rising God, The Devourer, Revenant of the Lost, Echoing Monolith) = 5, reanimation enablers (Starsea Traveler, Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Entomb) = 5, void-fill (Harvest the Forgotten, Ashborn Necromancer, Searcher in the Mists) = 3, ramp backup (Nexus Wayfinder, Virtuoso of Harmony) = 2. That is ~15 locked, plus strong cards (Forgotten Titan, Ashmaze Guide, Scrap Reclaimer) = ~18-20 locked.

**Build Diversity: MODERATE (2 builds)**

1. **All-In Reanimate** -- Max reanimation targets (The Devourer, The Rising God, Titan of Forgotten Echoes, Echoing Monolith, Keeper of Forgotten Light). Max enablers (Entomb, Path to Redemption, Architect of Memory). Relies entirely on getting expensive bodies into void and cheating them out. Fragile to void hate.
2. **Ramp Backup Bedrock** -- Fewer reanimation tricks, more Stone ramp (Nexus Wayfinder, Virtuoso of Harmony, Emerald Guardian, Dawnblade Wanderer). Can hard-cast expensive threats when void plan is disrupted. Less explosive but more resilient.

**Key Decisions:**
- How many reanimation targets is right? Too many = hand clogs with expensive cards you cannot cast. Too few = enablers have no targets. The sweet spot is 5-7, but which 5-7?
- The Devourer: 8-cost, 8 spark. Banish void with 8+: Reclaim. The ultimate target, but the void-banish condition is steep. Do you build around it specifically, or treat it as a bonus?
- Ashmaze Guide: Eclipse's primary card. If you get it, discarding expensive cards gives them Reclaim -- a secondary enabler path for Bedrock. If not, you rely more on Entomb and mill.
- Ramp density: How much of your deck is dedicated to the backup plan? More ramp = less all-in reanimator, more consistent but less spectacular.
- Speaker for the Forgotten: "When you play a Warrior, Reclaim random cost 3 or less." This card bridges Crucible and Bedrock. If you run a few Warriors (Ashen Avenger, Aspiring Guardian), it randomly Reclaims Revenant of the Lost. But it requires Warrior density Bedrock normally lacks.

**Auto-includes: ~8** (Echoing Monolith, Revenant of the Lost, Titan of Forgotten Echoes, Entomb, Starsea Traveler, Harvest the Forgotten, Nexus Wayfinder, Architect of Memory)

**Verdict: Moderate deckbuilding space.** The All-In vs. Ramp distinction is real, and the contested nature of key cards (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption) means your build shifts based on what you draft. However, the archetype is thin enough that many games come down to "did I find my enablers?" rather than "did I build my deck optimally?" The 2 new cards (Echoing Monolith, Entomb) are genuinely load-bearing -- without them, the archetype barely functions.

## Archetype Ranking: Most to Least Interesting Deckbuilding Space

| Rank | Archetype | Flex Slots | Build Variants | Auto-Includes | Overall Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Eclipse** | 12-14 | 3 (kindle/points/recursion) | 6 | Highest decision density, thinnest payoff layer creates puzzle |
| 2 | **Cinder** | 10-12 | 3 (kindle/points/control) | 10 | Excellent engine-building puzzle, three genuinely different axes |
| 3 | **Mirage** | 10-12 | 3 (tempo/big/wide) | 8 | Strong diversity, shared Basalt bridge creates draft tension |
| 4 | **Depths** | 10-12 | 3 (permission/ramp/tax) | 8 | Classic control deckbuilding with meaningful Prevent suite tuning |
| 5 | **Basalt** | 8-10 | 2-3 (tribal/engine/ramp) | 10 | Solid tribal with engine alternative |
| 6 | **Tempest** | 8-10 | 2 (big storm/chain) | 12 | Linear but the storm puzzle has inherent interest |
| 7 | **Gale** | 8-10 | 2 (musician/aggressive) | 10 | Musician core is too strong to skip; aggressive build is suboptimal |
| 8 | **Bedrock** | 8-10 | 2 (all-in/ramp) | 8 | Thin pool, contested cards force adaptation but not by choice |
| 9 | **Undertow** | 8-10 | 2 (tribal/void-volume) | 12 | Survivor package is too synergistic; always jam all of it |
| 10 | **Crucible** | 6-8 | 2 (lords/sacrifice) | 16 | Most auto-includes, least flex; drafts itself |

## "Flex Kings" -- Cards Contested by 3+ Archetypes

These cards create the most interesting draft moments because multiple archetypes genuinely want them, and their inclusion fundamentally shapes the deck that drafts them.

| Card | Archetypes That Want It | Why It Is Interesting |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Architect of Memory** | Undertow, Eclipse, Bedrock | The single most contested card in the format. Void >= 7 enables different things in each archetype: tribal Reclaim (Undertow), cycling Reclaim (Eclipse), reanimation Reclaim (Bedrock). Whoever gets this card shapes their deck around it. |
| **Path to Redemption** | Undertow, Eclipse, Bedrock | Mass Reclaim at 6 energy. Each archetype uses it differently but all consider it a top-5 pick. |
| **Reclaimer of Lost Paths** | Undertow, Bedrock, Cinder | Survivor body (Undertow tribal density), Materialized: Reclaim (Bedrock enabler), Cinder flex pick. |
| **Starlit Cascade** | Mirage, Cinder, Gale | "When ally leaves play, gain 2 energy." Flicker fuel (Mirage), sacrifice fuel (Cinder), bounce fuel (Gale). Completely different use cases but equally powerful in all three. |
| **Frost Visionary** | Mirage, Crucible, (Depths splash) | Warrior body with Materialized: Draw 1. Mirage flickers it 3-5 times; Crucible wants the tribal density; Depths may splash for a draw body. |
| **Celestial Reverie** | Tempest, Mirage, Basalt | "Play character: draw 1." Storm uses it for chain fuel; Mirage uses it for flicker draw; Basalt uses it for deployment draw. |
| **Angel of the Eclipse** | Mirage, Basalt, (Cinder fringe) | "Materialize ally: gain 1 energy." Core ramp for both flicker and Spirit Animal deployment strategies. |
| **Fell the Mighty** | Gale, Depths, (Cinder splash) | Premium fast removal. Gale uses it as primary; Depths splashes via pitch; Cinder uses the abandon-alternative mode. |
| **Abolish** | Depths, Gale, (any control splash) | The universal Prevent. Depths owns it but Gale and any control-leaning deck wants it. |
| **Nexus Wayfinder** | Depths, Basalt, Bedrock, Crucible | "Characters cost 2 less." Universal Stone ramp that every Stone-touching archetype wants. |
| **Harvest the Forgotten** | Undertow, Bedrock, (Tempest/Eclipse splash) | Mill 3, draw 1 at 1 cost. Primary self-mill for Undertow, secondary void-fill for Bedrock, chain link for Tempest. |
| **Shadowpaw** | Mirage, Basalt | Spirit Animal + void recursion on Materialized trigger. Both archetypes access via Zephyr but want it for completely different reasons. |

## Hidden Archetype Potential

### 1. "Void Storm" (Tide + Ruin + Ember) -- 3-Color Splinter

**Cards:** Leyline Detonation, Harvest the Forgotten, Entomb, Ashlight Caller, Whisper of the Past, Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Genesis Burst, Catalyst Ignition, Echoes of Eternity

**Concept:** Fill your void with cheap events (Harvest the Forgotten mills them; Entomb dumps characters), then use Leyline Detonation ("gain energy equal to events in void") as the payoff. Follow up with Genesis Burst to double that energy, then chain Echoes of Eternity + any event for a massive copied turn. This is neither Tempest (which chains from hand) nor Undertow (which cares about void size for Survivors) but a hybrid that uses void-as-resource for energy burst.

**Why v1 missed it:** The allocation treats Tempest as hand-based storm and Undertow as void-based tribal. Leyline Detonation explicitly bridges both strategies but was classified as purely Tempest.

### 2. "Materialize Tax" (Tide + Zephyr + Stone) -- 3-Color Splinter

**Cards:** Pallid Arbiter, Cloaked Sentinel, Tidestone Arbiter, Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, Flickerveil Adept, Frost Visionary, The Waking Titan, Virtuoso of Harmony

**Concept:** Combine Depths' tax effects (Pallid Arbiter disables Materialized, Cloaked Sentinel taxes events, Tidestone Arbiter taxes characters) with Basalt's Judgment engine (Conduit triggers all Judgment on materialize). Your Materialized abilities work but the opponent's don't. Meanwhile you ramp with Judgment triggers and control the game.

**Why v1 missed it:** Tax cards were assigned to Depths; materialize engine to Basalt/Mirage. No archetype combines both. The three resonances are Tide+Stone (Depths) and Zephyr+Stone (Basalt), meaning a player drafting Stone heavily with a Tide splash and a Zephyr splash could assemble this hybrid.

### 3. "Warrior Reanimator" (Stone + Ruin + Ember) -- 3-Color Splinter

**Cards:** Speaker for the Forgotten, Grim Reclaimer, Ashen Avenger, Revenant of the Lost, Starsea Traveler, Wolfbond Chieftain, Skyflame Commander, Entomb, Path to Redemption

**Concept:** Warrior tribal meets reanimation. Speaker for the Forgotten ("play Warrior: Reclaim random cost 3 or less") recurs cheap Warriors. Grim Reclaimer ("abandon ally: Reclaim a Warrior") creates a sacrifice-recursion loop within the Warrior shell. Entomb dumps expensive non-Warrior targets (Revenant of the Lost) while Warriors provide the tribal density for lords. Bridges Crucible, Cinder, and Bedrock.

**Why v1 missed it:** Warriors are assigned to Crucible (Stone+Ember); reanimation to Bedrock (Stone+Ruin). Speaker for the Forgotten and Grim Reclaimer specifically bridge these, but no archetype is designed around the combination.

### 4. "Fast Sacrifice" (Zephyr + Ember + Ruin) -- 3-Color Splinter

**Cards:** Herald of the Last Light, Pyrokinetic Surge, The Forsaker, Shattering Gambit, Wasteland Arbitrator, Sage of the Prelude, Soulbinder, Exiles of the Last Light, Resilient Wanderer

**Concept:** Deploy fast sacrifice bodies (Herald of the Last Light), trigger fast-matters payoffs (Sage draws per fast play, Intermezzo grows), and use sacrifice outlets (Soulbinder, Exiles) to generate abandon triggers while The Forsaker scores points. The fast bodies serve double duty as sacrifice fodder. Bridges Gale and Cinder.

**Why v1 missed it:** Gale is Zephyr+Ember (fast matters); Cinder is Ember+Ruin (sacrifice). A drafter heavy in Ember who picks up both fast payoffs and sacrifice payoffs could build this hybrid, but it lacks a dedicated signpost.

### 5. "Discard Flicker" (Tide + Zephyr + Ruin) -- 3-Color Splinter

**Cards:** Nocturne (Materialized: draw 1, discard 1, Reclaim 3), Mother of Flames, Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer, Voidweave Dancer, Urban Cipher, Fragments of Vision, Passage Through Oblivion

**Concept:** Flicker Nocturne and Urban Cipher repeatedly to generate discard triggers, feeding Mother of Flames for kindle and Voidweave Dancer for spark. Each flicker cycle = 1-2 discard triggers without spending hand cards. This solves Eclipse's core problem (running out of cards to discard) by using Materialized triggers as discard enablers.

**Why v1 missed it:** Eclipse is Zephyr+Ruin; Mirage is Tide+Zephyr. A drafter in Zephyr who picks up both flicker enablers and discard payoffs could build this. Nocturne is the key bridge card -- it is classified as Eclipse core but its Reclaim and Materialized ability make it a natural flicker target.

## Structural Observations

### The Auto-Include Problem

Crucible (16 auto-includes) and Undertow (12 auto-includes) are the most extreme cases where the archetype essentially builds itself. This is not inherently bad -- every card game needs some "safe, linear" archetypes for less experienced drafters. But if the goal is to maximize interesting decisions, these two archetypes need attention in v2 card design.

**Suggested fix for Crucible:** Introduce cards that create a tension between Warrior density and power level. A non-Warrior card that is individually more powerful than any Warrior but dilutes tribal payoffs would create a "purity vs. power" decision. Currently, Warriors are so self-contained that there is no reason to play non-Warriors.

**Suggested fix for Undertow:** Create a Survivor that explicitly anti-synergizes with other Survivors, or a non-Survivor void payoff that competes for deck slots. Currently, Soulkindler makes every Survivor better, creating a "more is always more" dynamic with zero tension.

### The Signpost Density Gap

Depths (1 dual signpost: Tidestone Arbiter) and Gale (1 dual signpost: Tempest Striker) are dramatically underserved compared to Undertow (4 duals) or Tempest (4 duals). While the final allocation document acknowledges this, it is worth reiterating: signpost cards are what tell a drafter "this archetype is open." With only 1 signpost each, Depths and Gale drafters get a weaker "this is open" signal, which makes these archetypes harder to enter.

### The Ruin Bottleneck

Four archetypes touch Ruin (Undertow, Eclipse, Cinder, Bedrock), and the three most contested cards in the format (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) are all mono-Ruin. This creates fascinating draft tension but also means that one of these four archetypes will be significantly weaker than the others in any given draft. Bedrock, as the thinnest archetype, is most vulnerable to losing these contested picks.

### Energy Availability

Several archetypes (Tempest, Basalt, Depths, Crucible) rely on energy generation but compete for a limited pool of energy-producing cards. Nexus Wayfinder (Stone, 4-way contested), Virtuoso of Harmony (Stone, 3-way contested), and Arc Gate Opening (Neutral) are the most contested energy cards. Archetypes that generate their own energy through tribal mechanisms (Basalt via Spirit Animals, Crucible via Warrior ramp) are more resilient than those that need generic energy cards (Depths, Tempest).

---

## Summary

The v1 design creates a format with genuine deckbuilding interest across most archetypes. The standouts are Eclipse, Cinder, Mirage, and Depths, which offer 3 meaningfully different builds each. The weakest deckbuilding experiences are Crucible (builds itself) and Undertow (Survivor package is too synergistic). The hidden 3-color strategies -- particularly Void Storm, Discard Flicker, and Warrior Reanimator -- represent untapped design space that could be made more accessible with targeted signpost cards in future rounds.

The format's healthiest dynamic is the Ruin bottleneck: four archetypes competing for three contested cards creates the kind of draft tension that makes every pick meaningful. The least healthy dynamic is Crucible's 16 auto-includes, which means one-sixth of the format's archetypes involve minimal deckbuilding decisions.
