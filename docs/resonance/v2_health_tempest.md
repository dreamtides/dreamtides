## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth: 9/10

Tempest has the deepest event-centric engine infrastructure in the game. From Tide it gets draw engines (Echoes of the Journey, The Power Within, Epiphany Unfolded), event recursion (Archive of the Forgotten, Whisper of the Past), and event search (Door to Possibility). From Ember it gets energy generation (Flash of Power, Genesis Burst, Catalyst Ignition, Data Pulse), event copying (Cascade of Reflections, Echoes of Eternity, Echo Architect, The Ringleader), and the payoff cards (Illumination of Glory, Spirit of Smoldering Echoes). This is the most redundant core engine in the format: if you lose one piece, there are multiple alternatives at each stage of the storm chain (fuel, amplify, payoff). The only reason this is not 10/10 is that the archetype lacks a cheap, common "glue" card at the 1-drop slot that naturally chains events without setup -- Guiding Light and Harvest the Forgotten are the closest, but neither is specifically designed as storm chain grease.

### Signpost Quality: 9/10

Stormtide Oracle is an excellent signpost. It solves the v1 problem of Tempest relying on "2+ events this turn" by using cumulative event-count-in-void as its scaling axis. As a body, it grows naturally over the game (5-7 spark by midgame is realistic), and the Judgment retrieval ability creates a genuine tension: recovering an event from void shrinks your spark on this body. This is exactly the kind of decision that separates good Tempest play from autopilot. The only minor weakness is that at 4 cost, it comes down turn 2-3 at the earliest, meaning early-game Tempest is still signposted by Keeper of the Lightpath, Oracle of Shifting Skies, and Data Pulse rather than the dual signpost itself. This is fine for a storm archetype that needs setup time anyway.

### Mechanical Coherence: 8/10

Tempest's mechanical identity is clear: play many events in a turn, generate energy, draw cards, copy/amplify events, and convert that into points or spark. Every piece of the engine has a defined role. The coherence weakness is that Tide's Prevent suite (8+ cards including Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, etc.) is mechanically off-identity for a storm deck. These cards protect the Tempest pilot but do not advance the storm plan, creating a pool dilution issue where ~20% of the Tide cards are reactive control pieces meant for Depths rather than Tempest. This is mitigated by Duskwatch Vigil [NEW], which converts Prevents into discounted follow-up events -- a genuine bridge between Tide's reactive and Tempest's proactive identities. Additionally, the large Ember sacrifice/abandon package (~15 cards: Cinder-primary) is irrelevant noise for Tempest. The archetype must navigate past roughly 25-30 "trap" cards to find its 35-40 card engine. This is normal for a 110-card pool, but it means draft skill matters more for Tempest than for more self-contained archetypes.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 8/10

Tempest's signals are relatively clean. Cards like Cascade of Reflections, Echo Architect, Illumination of Glory, Echoes of the Journey, and The Power Within are near-unplayable outside Tempest, meaning seeing them late signals the archetype is open. Keeper of the Lightpath is a strong early pick that is only shared with Depths (marginally). The new Stormtide Oracle is Rare and dual-resonance, so it will be seen infrequently, but when it appears it is an unmistakable signal. Data Pulse's move to Ember is a slight clarity loss (a generic good card no longer in Tide), but overall the signals are strong. The main risk is that Tempest shares its draw infrastructure (Epiphany Unfolded, Echoes of the Journey) with generic Tide value, so a drafter cannot be sure if the Tide drafter to the right is Tempest or Depths based on those signals alone.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 7/10

This is Tempest's relative weakness. The archetype is fundamentally a combo deck: it needs energy generation, event density, event amplification, and a payoff. Each of those roles requires specific cards. While there is redundancy within each role, there is limited room to go off-script. You cannot build an "aggro Tempest" or a "control Tempest" in the same way you can build different flavors of Crucible or Cinder. However, v2 does improve flexibility meaningfully through:
- Stormtide Oracle (cumulative scaling, not burst-dependent)
- Archivist of Vanished Names (tutoring engine, not "play lots of events")
- Dreamtide Cartographer (hand-empty refuel for aggressive storm variants)
- Duskwatch Vigil (Prevent-into-discount for a more reactive Tempest)

These create at least 2 distinct Tempest builds (see Section 4), up from v1's essentially single build path. The 7/10 reflects that even with this improvement, Tempest remains the most constrained archetype in the format.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Duskwatch Vigil (Tide, NEW) -- The Prevent-Storm Bridge

This card is easy to overlook because "When you prevent, next event costs 2 less" reads like a Depths card. But in Tempest, it converts defensive plays into storm fuel. Chain: opponent plays a card, you Prevent with Ripple of Defiance (1 energy), Duskwatch Vigil triggers, your next event costs 2 less. If that next event is Cascade of Reflections (normally 3 energy, now 1 energy), your storm turn just got dramatically cheaper. This transforms dead Prevent cards in hand from defensive necessities into active enablers for the combo turn. It also makes Tempest far more resilient to opponents who try to disrupt the storm turn -- every disruption you counter funds the next event in the chain.

### 2. Ashen Threshold (Ember, NEW) -- Zone-Transition Energy

Looks like a Mirage/Cinder card, but Tempest can leverage the "ally leaves play" trigger in a subtle way. Packcaller of Shadows creates figments based on cards played this turn, and if those figments get dissolved (via Burst of Obliteration, self-targeting effects, or simply being 0-spark bodies that die to enemy effects), each one triggers 1 energy from Ashen Threshold. In a big storm turn where you create 3-4 figments, that is 3-4 energy recovery when they inevitably die. More importantly, the "once per turn void materialize: draw 1" clause pairs with Whisper of the Past and Stormtide Oracle's retrieval -- any event you Reclaim from void and replay draws you a card through Ashen Threshold.

### 3. Harvest the Forgotten (Tide, existing, now mono-Tide) -- The Stealth Storm Card

At 1 energy for "Mill 3, draw 1," this looks like an Undertow card. But in Tempest, it performs three critical functions: (a) it is a 1-cost event that increases your "cards played this turn" count for Echoes of the Journey and Illumination of Glory; (b) it replaces itself immediately (draw 1), maintaining hand size during the storm chain; (c) it mills 3 cards, feeding events into void for Stormtide Oracle's spark scaling and for Whisper of the Past / Archive of the Forgotten to retrieve later. With Keeper of the Lightpath on the battlefield, this costs 0 energy -- a free cantrip that advances every Tempest axis simultaneously. Under Cascade of Reflections, each copy mills 3 and draws 1.

---

## 4. Two Distinct Builds

### Build A: "Big Storm" -- Classic Burst Tempest

**Core (20-22 cards):**
- Energy generation: Flash of Power, Genesis Burst, Catalyst Ignition, Data Pulse, Arc Gate Opening, Glimpse of Infinity
- Draw/chain fuel: Echoes of the Journey, The Power Within, Epiphany Unfolded, Guiding Light, Harvest the Forgotten
- Event amplification: Cascade of Reflections, Echoes of Eternity, The Ringleader or Echo Architect
- Payoff: Illumination of Glory, Stormtide Oracle, Spirit of Smoldering Echoes
- Cost reduction: Keeper of the Lightpath
- Recursion: Whisper of the Past, Archive of the Forgotten

**Game plan:** Spend turns 1-3 deploying Keeper of the Lightpath, Oracle of Shifting Skies, and accumulating cards. Turn 4-5, fire the combo: Genesis Burst to double energy, Cascade of Reflections for copy mode, then chain cheap events (Data Pulse, Harvest the Forgotten, Guiding Light at reduced costs). Each event draws more, generates more energy, copies itself, and feeds Illumination of Glory. Stormtide Oracle provides a massive body as a backup win condition.

**v2 impact on "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem:** This build still cares about events-played-per-turn, but the v2 additions meaningfully diversify the payoff layer. Stormtide Oracle rewards *cumulative* event history (events in void) rather than single-turn burst. Spirit of Smoldering Echoes counts *event void entries*, not events played. Archive of the Forgotten provides selective recursion rather than "play more events." The net effect is that even in the burst build, the *scoring* axis is no longer monolithic -- you score through Illumination of Glory (burst), Stormtide Oracle (cumulative spark), and Spirit of Smoldering Echoes (void growth) simultaneously, each caring about a different metric.

**Assessment:** v2 reduces the homogeneity of this build from "all cards want 5+ events this turn" to "cards want different flavors of event engagement." This is a genuine improvement. The burst shell is still recognizable, but the deckbuilder now chooses between Illumination of Glory (pure burst payoff, needs 5+ events), Stormtide Oracle (grows over time, can score even if storm fizzles), and Spirit of Smoldering Echoes (incremental, fires every time an event enters void including from mill).

### Build B: "Slow Burn" -- Reactive Tempest with Cumulative Scaling

**Core (20-22 cards):**
- Value engine: Stormtide Oracle, Archivist of Vanished Names, Dreamtide Cartographer
- Prevent package: Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Duskwatch Vigil, Ripple Through Reality, Cragfall
- Event recursion: Archive of the Forgotten, Whisper of the Past, Stormtide Oracle (retrieval)
- Energy: Data Pulse, Aurora Channeler, Arc Gate Opening
- Removal: Unleash Ruin, Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge
- Card advantage: Echoes of the Journey, The Calling Night, Knowledge Restored
- Bodies: Keeper of the Lightpath, Oracle of Shifting Skies, Pallid Arbiter

**Game plan:** Play a controlling game. Deploy Stormtide Oracle early and let it grow as events naturally enter the void through play and mill. Use Duskwatch Vigil to convert defensive Prevents into tempo plays. Archivist of Vanished Names tutors for whatever you need -- name Event to find removal or draw, and incidentally mill characters into the void. Stormtide Oracle's Judgment retrieval lets you replay key events from void, functioning as a slow grinding value engine rather than a burst combo. Dreamtide Cartographer's draw mode refuels after reactive turns where you spent cards on Prevents.

**v2 impact on "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem:** This build *does not care* about "2+ events this turn" at all. It wins through cumulative event presence in void (Stormtide Oracle's spark), card selection (Archivist), and sustained value (Prevent-to-discount via Duskwatch Vigil). The Power Within and Cascade of Reflections are absent from this build. This is a fundamentally different Tempest that did not exist in v1.

**Assessment:** This is the strongest evidence that v2 successfully addresses the homogeneity problem. Build B plays like a Tide-heavy control deck that incidentally grows a massive Stormtide Oracle over 8-10 turns, rather than a combo deck that needs to fire on one critical turn. The existence of this build means that two Tempest drafters could coexist at the same table with minimal card overlap: one takes Cascade of Reflections/Illumination of Glory/Genesis Burst (combo pieces), the other takes Prevents/Archivist/removal (control pieces). Both want Stormtide Oracle and Keeper of the Lightpath, but the remaining 80% of their decks diverge.

## 5. Problems Flagged

### Problem 1: Ember Cinder Package Is 30% Noise

Of the 45 mono-Ember cards, approximately 15 are Cinder-specific abandon/sacrifice cards (Harvester of Despair, Blade of Oblivion, Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker, Infernal Ascendant, Shardwoven Tyrant, Grim Reclaimer, Specter of Silent Snow, Soulbinder, Exiles of the Last Light, Ashen Remnant, Spirit Reaping, Desperation, Pulse of Sacrifice, Prophet of the Consumed). These are almost entirely useless for Tempest -- you have no sacrifice targets to fuel them, and spending a card to abandon an ally is the opposite of what a storm deck wants. This means Tempest effectively has access to ~30 playable Ember cards, not 45. While this is structurally inevitable (Ember is shared with Cinder, Crucible, and Gale, each with different interests), it does mean that in a draft, Ember packs will frequently contain 2-3 Cinder sacrifice cards that are dead for Tempest, potentially leading to frustration or mispick traps.

**Severity:** Low. This is a feature, not a bug -- navigating irrelevant cards in a shared color pool is core to draft skill. But it is worth noting that Tempest is more vulnerable to this than most archetypes because its Ember half is specifically interested in a narrow slice (events, energy, removal) while ignoring the dominant Ember theme (abandon).

### Problem 2: Warrior Tribal Cards Are Stranded

Ember contains 7 cards that care about Warrior tribal (The Dread Sovereign, Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, Judgment of the Blade, Fury of the Clan, Ride of the Vanguard, Eclipse Herald). Tide has only 3 Warriors (Tranquil Duelist, Frost Visionary, Pallid Arbiter). Tempest cannot realistically assemble enough Warriors to make Warrior-tribal cards functional. These 10 cards (7 Ember Warrior-matters + 3 Tide Warriors that are individually fine but not a critical mass) contribute to the noise problem described above, though each Warrior card does serve a home in Crucible.

**Severity:** Low. These cards were not designed for Tempest. They exist to support Crucible (Stone+Ember). Tempest drafters quickly learn to skip them.

### Problem 3: No Fast Event Payoff Unique to Tempest

Gale (Zephyr+Ember) has the Musician fast-card payoff package (Sage of the Prelude, Intermezzo Balladeer, Melodist of the Finale). Tempest has access to Ember's fast events (Immolate, Shatter the Frail, Pyrokinetic Surge, Shattering Gambit, Fell the Mighty) but no Tempest-specific payoff for playing fast events. This is a missed opportunity because many Tide cards are fast events (Prevents), and an "event storm" deck that chains fast and regular events would be flavorful. As-is, if Tempest plays fast events, it is for their raw effect, not for synergy payoff.

**Severity:** Low. Duskwatch Vigil partially addresses this by rewarding Prevents specifically. But a more general "play events during opponent's turn" payoff could have given Tempest a third build axis.

### Problem 4: Energy Payoff Bottleneck

Tempest generates enormous amounts of energy (Genesis Burst, Catalyst Ignition, Flash of Power, Arc Gate Opening, Glimpse of Infinity), but the payoffs for having excess energy are limited. The main energy sinks are: playing more events (natural), Dreamscatter (pay X: draw X), Secrets of the Deep (pay X: draw X, discard 2), and the various high-cost events. There is no Tempest-specific "if you have 10+ energy, do something spectacular" card. Starcatcher (now Stone) used to be in Ember and provided "play event: gain 1 energy," but now that Starcatcher is Stone, Tempest can still access it via its Tide half (it cannot -- Starcatcher is Stone, and Tide is not Stone). Wait -- re-checking: Starcatcher is now in Stone. Tempest is Tide+Ember. Stone is not in Tempest's pool. So Starcatcher is NOT accessible to Tempest.

**Correction:** Starcatcher's move from Ember to Stone actually removes a key piece from Tempest. In v1, Starcatcher (Ember) gave Tempest "play event: gain 1 energy," which was an energy-positive loop enabler. In v2, this is gone. Tempest still has Keeper of the Lightpath ("events cost 1 less") from Tide, which serves a similar function from the cost-reduction side, but losing the energy-generation-per-event piece hurts the storm engine's self-sustaining capability.

**Severity:** Medium. This is a genuine loss for Tempest. The allocation notes say "Tempest accesses via Ember half" for Data Pulse and "Tempest, Basalt" for Starcatcher's primary archetype, but Starcatcher is now mono-Stone, which Tempest cannot access. The allocation document lists Starcatcher at Stone #32 with "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" -- this appears to be an error, since Tempest (Tide+Ember) does not have access to Stone cards. Either Starcatcher's archetype tag should not list Tempest, or the card should be in a resonance Tempest can reach.

### Problem 5: High Legendary Dependency

Two of Tempest's most powerful cards are Legendary: Epiphany Unfolded (1 mana draw 3) and Moment Rewound (extra turn). Both are format-defining in the archetype. Without them, the storm deck loses its ceiling plays. This is a design choice, not a bug, but it means Tempest's power level varies more between drafts than other archetypes. When you open Epiphany Unfolded, the deck is borderline degenerate. Without it, you are relying on Echoes of the Journey (conditional) and Knowledge Restored (expensive) for big draw turns.

**Severity:** Low-Medium. Legendary cards being powerful is expected. But Tempest is more Legendary-dependent than most archetypes because the storm combo's ceiling is gated by burst draw, and the Legendary is the best burst draw by a wide margin.

## Summary Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 9/10 | Deepest event engine in the format. Redundant pieces at every role. |
| Signpost Quality | 9/10 | Stormtide Oracle is a top-3 signpost design. Cumulative scaling solves the v1 monotony. |
| Mechanical Coherence | 8/10 | Strong event-chain identity. Diluted by ~25 Cinder/Crucible cards in the Ember pool. |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 8/10 | Storm-specific cards are unambiguous signals. Shared draw infrastructure creates mild ambiguity. |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 7/10 | v2 creates a genuinely new "Slow Burn" build. Still the most constrained archetype. |
| **Overall** | **8.2/10** | **Excellent archetype with strong v2 improvements. The event-count homogeneity problem is substantially addressed.** |

### Key v2 Verdict

The v2 changes **successfully reduce the "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem.** The evidence:
1. Stormtide Oracle uses cumulative void-event count, not turn-based event count.
2. Archivist of Vanished Names provides a non-"play many events" engine (tutoring + incidental mill).
3. Duskwatch Vigil creates a Prevent-to-discount loop that rewards *reactive* play, not proactive event spam.
4. Dreamtide Cartographer's hand-empty draw mode rewards the aftermath of a storm turn, not the storm itself.
5. Two genuinely distinct builds exist (Big Storm vs Slow Burn) with minimal card overlap.

The residual homogeneity risk is that both builds ultimately want Keeper of the Lightpath and Stormtide Oracle, creating a "must-have pair" bottleneck. But this is appropriate for archetype signpost cards.
