# Ruin Advocate Position Paper -- V2 Design Council

## The Ruin Oversubscription Problem

Ruin is unique among the five resonances: it serves **four archetypes** (Undertow, Eclipse, Cinder, Bedrock), more than any other resonance. With 45 mono-Ruin cards at the ceiling of the 38-45 target range, this is the most contested resonance in draft.

The sub-theme differentiation is the v2 design's greatest achievement in Ruin space:
- **Undertow:** Self-mill, void volume, Survivor tribal
- **Eclipse:** Self-discard payoffs
- **Cinder:** Sacrifice/abandon loops, dissolved triggers
- **Bedrock:** Expensive reanimation from void

However, three **shared infrastructure cards** create pinch points that all four archetypes want: **Architect of Memory** (universal Reclaim at void 7+), **Path to Redemption** (mass Reclaim), and **Reclaimer of Lost Paths** (targeted Reclaim 0). In a draft with 2+ Ruin drafters, these cards become first-pick quality, and the archetype that misses them suffers disproportionately. This is mostly healthy draft tension, but it means the weakest Ruin archetype (Bedrock) gets squeezed hardest.

**Ruin is at 45 cards -- the absolute ceiling.** No new mono-Ruin cards can be added without raising the cap or cutting existing ones. This constrains our ability to fix problems through the Ruin side alone. Solutions must come from the *partner resonances* (Tide, Zephyr, Ember, Stone) providing better mechanical bridges to Ruin's identity.

## Archetype-by-Archetype Assessment

### Undertow (Tide+Ruin): A- (8.2/10) -- The Strongest Ruin Archetype

**Verdict: Healthy. The benchmark for Ruin archetype design.**

Undertow has the deepest core in the entire format. Redundant mill sources (7+), layered void payoffs, robust Survivor tribal (20 Survivors in pool), and two genuinely distinct builds (Survivor Swarm vs. Void Engine). The v2 additions (Abyssal Reclaimer, Tidechannel Observer, Archivist of Vanished Names, Voidthorn Protector) each address distinct needs.

**Concerns:**
- Undertow's strength means it has "first claim" on shared Ruin infrastructure cards in draft. When Undertow is open, it absorbs Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, and the best Survivors before weaker Ruin archetypes can access them.
- Over-reliance on Soulkindler (single uncommon) for Build A's spark competitiveness.
- Void-banish vulnerability (Soulflame Predator) is binary but healthy.

**Position:** Undertow needs no buffs. If anything, we should ensure it isn't taking resources from weaker Ruin siblings. The question is whether some cards currently tagged "Undertow primary" could be retagged to signal toward Eclipse, Cinder, or Bedrock.

### Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin): B (7.2/10) -- Substantially Improved, Still Has Gaps

**Verdict: The "thin payoff layer" from v1 is resolved, but structural weaknesses remain.**

Voidthread Weaver is an excellent signpost. 11 dedicated discard payoffs + 10 enablers = genuine engine. Eclipse moved from C-/D+ to solid B. The two builds (Void Weaver engine vs. Discard Aggro) are viable.

**Remaining Concerns:**
1. **All payoffs concentrated in Ruin.** If Ruin is contested, Eclipse keeps its Zephyr cycling enablers but loses payoffs -- a deck of cycling with nothing to cycle into.
2. **Dreamtide Cartographer inaccessibility.** Listed as Eclipse primary archetype, but mono-Tide is inaccessible to Zephyr+Ruin. This is a design intent failure.
3. **No in-resonance unconditional removal.** Relies on neutral removal or Duneveil Vanguard's conditional dissolve.
4. **Deckbuilding on a single axis.** Both builds revolve around discard cycling. Less strategic diversity than other archetypes.

**Position:** Eclipse needs either Dreamtide Cartographer moved to Zephyr (where its hand-emptying mode makes more mechanical sense), or a new Zephyr card that provides a discard payoff -- breaking the "all payoffs in Ruin" concentration.

### Cinder (Ember+Ruin): A (8.4/10) -- The Highest-Rated Ruin Archetype

**Verdict: Dominant sacrifice engine with one structural weakness.**

Ashfire Ritualist is a model signpost. 18+ abandon cards, deep recursion pipeline, clearest draft signals in the format. Two builds (Sacrifice Engine vs. Dissolved Aristocrats) are genuinely distinct.

**Key Concern: Fodder Scarcity.**
Cinder has abundant sacrifice outlets but a surprisingly thin supply of cheap, expendable bodies. The truly "sacrifice me repeatedly" cards number only 4-5 (Ashen Remnant, Resilient Wanderer, Exiles of the Last Light, Nightmare Manifest). Figment generators (Radiant Trio, Endless Projection) cost 3-4 energy before the sacrifice engine even starts.

**Secondary Concerns:**
- Ruin's 19 Survivors create a draft trap: Cinder drafters accumulate Survivors that want density (Undertow's plan) rather than sacrifice.
- Sacrifice-gated draw means empty boards = no recovery.
- Limited Prevent/interaction beyond self-sacrificing one-shots.

**Position:** Cinder's fodder problem is best addressed through its Ember half. One more cheap Ember character (1-2 cost) designed as sacrifice fodder would significantly improve the archetype. This is an Ember advocate discussion.

### Bedrock (Stone+Ruin): C+ (6.8/10) -- The Weakest Ruin Archetype (and Weakest Overall)

**Verdict: Massively improved from v1 but still the format's most fragile archetype.**

Roothold Keeper + Deepvault Keeper create a viable economic engine. Risen Champion adds Warrior recursion. The accessible pool jumped from 23 to 110 cards.

**Critical Problems:**
1. **Stone Pool Mismatch.** Of Stone's 40 cards, only ~10-15 serve Bedrock's core plan. The 12 Warrior tribal cards compete with Crucible. The 7 Spirit Animals are pure Basalt noise. The 5 new Stone cards primarily serve Crucible/Basalt/Depths -- only Deepvault Keeper is a direct Bedrock enabler.
2. **Mechanical Coherence (6/10).** Stone's identity (permanence, Judgment, ramp) and Ruin's identity (void, Reclaim, death) overlap only at the narrow Deepvault Keeper + Speaker for the Forgotten bridge. This is the weakest mechanical coherence of any archetype.
3. **Ruin Competition.** Undertow wants the same shared infrastructure (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) and has a more robust fallback. When Ruin is contested, Bedrock is the first archetype to collapse.
4. **Two-piece combo fragility.** Must both fill the void AND find enablers. Drawing expensive targets without enablers (or vice versa) creates non-games.
5. **No fast-speed interaction.** Zero fast events or fast characters in the core plan.
6. **Top-heavy mana curve.** Best payoffs cost 5-9 energy.

**Position:** Bedrock needs the most help. The fix must come from Stone side, since Ruin is at ceiling. I will advocate strongly to the Stone advocate for 1-2 Stone cards that bridge to void play -- a Stone character that triggers on "play from void," or a Stone event that mills. This is the single highest priority for the Ruin advocate.

## Specific Proposals

### Proposal 1: Move Dreamtide Cartographer from Mono-Tide to Mono-Zephyr
**Impact:** Gives Eclipse and Gale access. Eclipse gets its hellbent draw engine; Gale gets a refuel tool. Tempest (Tide+Ember) loses a supplementary card but has 9/10 core depth.
**Trade:** This is primarily a Tide-Zephyr discussion, but it benefits two Ruin archetypes (Eclipse, Bedrock-via-Gale). I'll advocate to both Tide and Zephyr advocates.

### Proposal 2: Request 1-2 Stone Cards for Bedrock's Void-Play Bridge
**Impact:** Directly addresses Bedrock's 6/10 mechanical coherence.
**Options:**
- A Stone character with "When you materialize a character from your void, gain 2 energy"
- A Stone event that mills (putting cards into void from Stone's side)
- A Stone character with "Characters you play from your void have +2 spark until end of turn"
**Trade:** I need the Stone advocate's support. I can offer to deprioritize Ruin claims on shared Reclaim cards in Bedrock's favor if Stone provides better mechanical bridges.

### Proposal 3: Request 1 Cheap Ember Sacrifice Fodder for Cinder
**Impact:** Addresses Cinder's fodder scarcity. A 1-cost Ember character with a small Materialized effect (gain 1 energy? draw 1?) that is designed to be sacrificed repeatedly.
**Trade:** This is an Ember discussion. I'll negotiate with the Ember advocate.

### Proposal 4: Acknowledge and Clean Up Archetype Tag Errors
- Remove Gale from Duskwatch Vigil and Voidthorn Protector primary archetype tags (Gale can't access mono-Tide or mono-Ruin)
- Remove Eclipse from Dreamtide Cartographer's primary archetype tag (unless it moves to Zephyr)
- Remove Bedrock from Ashen Threshold's primary archetype tag (Bedrock can't access mono-Ember)
**Impact:** Prevents future design intent confusion.

### Proposal 5: Consider a Ruin-Internal Rebalance for Bedrock
Tidechannel Observer's "3+ void entries per turn" threshold explicitly favors Undertow/Eclipse/Cinder over Bedrock. This was a deliberate design choice to differentiate void-velocity (fast, many entries) from void-quality (few, expensive entries). However, Bedrock has no new Ruin card that rewards its specific play pattern (few big void plays rather than many small ones). If a future card could reward "playing a character with cost 5+ from void," it would create Bedrock-specific Ruin payoff space.

## Summary: Ruin Archetype Rankings

| Archetype | Grade | Key Need | Fix Comes From |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Cinder** | A (8.4) | Cheap fodder bodies | Ember |
| **Undertow** | A- (8.2) | Nothing critical | Already healthy |
| **Eclipse** | B (7.2) | Zephyr-side payoff + Dreamtide Cartographer access | Zephyr (+ Tide swap) |
| **Bedrock** | C+ (6.8) | Stone-side void bridge | Stone |

**My priority order:** Bedrock > Eclipse > Cinder > Undertow.

Bedrock is the format's weakest archetype and the greatest risk to Ruin's reputation. If Bedrock trainwrecks regularly, drafters learn "avoid Ruin" rather than "avoid Bedrock specifically," which hurts all four Ruin archetypes' draft viability. Fixing Bedrock is not just a Bedrock issue -- it protects the entire Ruin ecosystem.

## Revised Archetype 1: Undertow (Tide+Ruin) -- A- (8.2/10) → FINAL: A- (8.2/10, unchanged)

**Verdict: Healthy. The format benchmark. No changes needed.**

Undertow remains the strongest Ruin archetype and one of the top 4 archetypes in the format. The council discussions confirmed what was already clear: Undertow's depth is exceptional and its two builds (Survivor Swarm vs. Void Engine) provide genuine strategic diversity.

**Council Impact:**
- Dreamtide Cartographer moving to Zephyr removes one supplementary card from Undertow's pool (via Tide). This is a marginal loss -- Undertow's 9/10 core depth easily absorbs it. The card was never a core Undertow piece.
- The Tide advocate confirmed Undertow's Ashlight Caller tag needs cleanup (remove "Tempest") but flagged no other Undertow concerns.
- The Ruin oversubscription problem primarily affects the *weaker* Ruin archetypes, not Undertow. Undertow has first claim on shared infrastructure because its mill engine creates the largest voids.

**Remaining Concerns (unchanged, all acceptable):**
1. Soulkindler single-point-of-failure for Survivor Swarm build. Tide advocate and I both flagged this; Ruin's ceiling prevents adding a redundant anthem. This is a known limitation that creates draft skill testing.
2. Void-banish vulnerability (Soulflame Predator) is binary but healthy counterplay.
3. Undertow's strength creates draft-table pressure on weaker Ruin siblings -- a structural feature, not a fixable problem.

**Final Grade Rationale:** No change. Undertow is operating exactly as intended. The v2 additions (Abyssal Reclaimer, Tidechannel Observer, Archivist of Vanished Names, Voidthorn Protector) each filled distinct needs without creating redundancy. This is the gold standard for Ruin archetype design.

---

## Revised Archetype 2: Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) -- B (7.2/10) → FINAL: B+ (7.5/10, conditional on Cartographer move)

**Verdict: Substantially improved. The Cartographer move pushes Eclipse from "functional" to "competitive."**

Eclipse's council outcome is the most positive of my four archetypes. The Dreamtide Cartographer move (universally supported) directly addresses the archetype's two biggest problems: inaccessible design-target cards and payoff concentration in Ruin.

**What the Cartographer Move Fixes:**
1. **Accessibility.** Eclipse gains its intended draw engine. "3 or fewer in hand: draw 2" rewards the discard-heavy play pattern that Eclipse naturally executes. This was always a Zephyr-coded mechanic dressed in Tide clothing.
2. **Resilience to Ruin contests.** When Ruin is heavily drafted, Eclipse loses discard payoffs. But with Cartographer in Zephyr, Eclipse retains a self-fueling draw engine even when Ruin payoffs are contested. This raises the archetype's floor.
3. **Build diversity.** Cartographer enables a third micro-build: "Hellbent Eclipse" that prioritizes hand-emptying tempo over void-accumulation control. This joins the existing Void Weaver Engine and Discard Aggro builds.

**Zephyr Advocate's Analysis Confirms My Position:**
The Zephyr advocate's final assessment identified 6-7 "Eclipse-exclusive" Ruin cards (Apocalypse Vigilante, Mother of Flames, Pattern Seeker, Ashmaze Guide, Duneveil Vanguard, Forgotten Titan) that other Ruin archetypes don't want. This differentiation is better than I initially feared in my position paper. Eclipse's Ruin competition is primarily with Cinder for Torchbearer of the Abyss and Emberwatch Veteran -- manageable given Eclipse's exclusive payoffs.

**Remaining Concerns (reduced severity):**
1. **All payoffs still character-based.** Dissolve effects shut down the entire engine. This is intentional counterplay but creates fragility. (Unchanged)
2. **No unconditional in-resonance removal.** Eclipse relies on Duneveil Vanguard (conditional), neutral removal, and Zephyr bounce. (Unchanged)
3. **Deckbuilding flexibility at 6/10.** Both primary builds revolve around discard cycling. The Cartographer move adds a third variant but doesn't fundamentally change the single-axis nature. (Slightly improved)

**Grade Change Rationale:** +0.3 (7.2 → 7.5). The Cartographer move fixes the single biggest design intent failure flagged in Eclipse's health check. Access to a hand-emptying draw engine in Zephyr creates the cross-resonance payoff redundancy that Eclipse was missing. This doesn't fix the structural single-axis concern, but it makes Eclipse competitive within that axis.

---

## Revised Archetype 3: Cinder (Ember+Ruin) -- A (8.4/10) → FINAL: A (8.4/10, unchanged)

**Verdict: Format-leading. The fodder concern is a feature, not a bug.**

My initial position paper flagged fodder scarcity as Cinder's key weakness and proposed a cheap Ember sacrifice body ("Smolder Sprite"). After discussion with the Ember advocate, I've revised my position: **the fodder constraint is healthy design.**

**Why I Changed My Mind on Fodder:**
The Ember advocate's analysis convinced me:
1. The existing fodder tools (Aspiring Guardian at 0, Nightmare Manifest at 1, Radiant Trio for 3 figments, Endless Projection for ongoing figments) are sufficient IF drafted intentionally.
2. The "scarcity" is a draft skill test. Cinder drafters who prioritize figment generators alongside sacrifice outlets outperform those who load up purely on payoffs. This prevents Cinder from being autopilot.
3. Adding more cheap bodies risks making Cinder's engine too consistent, reducing the meaningful decisions that keep it at A-tier rather than "broken."

**The Survivor Split Is Elegant (Confirmed by Ember Advocate):**
- "Cinder Survivors" (dissolved triggers): Silent Avenger, Seer of the Fallen, Dustborn Veteran, Sunset Chronicler -- want to DIE
- "Undertow Survivors" (tribal density): Hope's Vanguard, Soulkindler, Veil of the Wastes -- want to STAY ALIVE
- These naturally sort between archetypes with minimal draft competition within the Survivor pool. My initial "Survivor trap" concern was overstated.

**Tidechannel Observer Confirmed as Breakout:**
All four other advocates independently praised Tidechannel Observer's void-velocity metric. The 3+ void entries threshold naturally differentiates Undertow (mill), Cinder (sacrifice), and Eclipse (discard) from Bedrock (rarely hits). This is the most important mechanical innovation in the v2 batch for Ruin's internal identity.

**Remaining Concerns (unchanged, all acceptable):**
1. Recovery from empty-board states is poor (sacrifice-gated draw = no board → no draw → no recovery). This is Cinder's intended weakness.
2. Banish effects bypass the entire recursion strategy -- healthy counterplay.
3. Ember ceiling at 45 means no room for additional support. Given 8.4/10, no support is needed.

**Grade Rationale:** No change. Cinder was already the format's best archetype and the council discussions only reinforced this assessment. The fodder constraint, properly understood, is what makes Cinder a skill-testing A-tier archetype rather than a degenerate S-tier one.

---

## Revised Archetype 4: Bedrock (Stone+Ruin) -- C+ (6.8/10) → FINAL: B- (7.2/10, conditional on Vaultstone Harbinger + Roothold Keeper changes)

**Verdict: The format's biggest fix opportunity. Stone advocate has actively committed to solving it.**

Bedrock's council outcome is the most significant of any archetype in the format. The Stone advocate not only acknowledged Bedrock's problems but proposed a specific, well-designed solution card. This is the highest-priority remaining design work.

**Stone Advocate's Proposal: Vaultstone Harbinger**
- 3 energy, Stone, Character, Ancient, 1 spark, Uncommon
- "When you materialize a character from your void, gain 2 energy. Judgment: If a character entered your void this turn, kindle 1."
- Primary: Bedrock. Secondary: Depths, Crucible (tertiary via recursion loops).

**Why This Card Fixes Bedrock's Core Problem:**
1. **Second Stone-Bedrock bridge** (currently only Deepvault Keeper). This doubles the Stone-side mechanical support for void play.
2. **Energy economy.** The void-materialize energy refund directly funds more Reclaim plays. With Deepvault Keeper's cost reduction AND Vaultstone Harbinger's energy refund, Roothold Keeper becomes net-positive energy from void.
3. **Kindle from void interaction.** The Judgment kindle with void-entry condition rewards both mill (filling void) and recursion (playing from void), serving both of Bedrock's phases.
4. **Ancient subtype.** Connects to Speaker for the Forgotten's "play → Reclaim" chain without polluting Warrior or Spirit Animal tribal.

**Roothold Keeper to 1 Spark:**
The Stone advocate also supports bumping Roothold Keeper from 0 to 1 spark. Every other signpost in the format contributes to Judgment scoring. Roothold Keeper at 0 spark is pure engine -- it dilutes board scoring by occupying a battlefield slot with zero points. At 2-cost with a void-only restriction, 1 spark is fair and brings the signpost in line with format standards.

**Combined Impact Assessment:**

| Dimension | Current | With Changes | Δ |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---|
| Core Depth | 7/10 | 7/10 | — |
| Signpost Quality | 7/10 | 7.5/10 | +0.5 (Roothold Keeper scores) |
| Mechanical Coherence | 6/10 | 7.5/10 | +1.5 (Vaultstone Harbinger bridges) |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 7/10 | 7/10 | — |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 7/10 | 7/10 | — |
| **Average** | **6.8** | **7.2** | **+0.4** |

The +1.5 on mechanical coherence is the key move. Bedrock's 6/10 was the lowest coherence score in the format -- the near-opposite identities of Stone (permanence) and Ruin (transience) overlapping at only one card (Deepvault Keeper). Adding Vaultstone Harbinger as a second bridge fundamentally changes the archetype's structural integrity.

**What Remains Problematic (even with fixes):**
1. **Two-piece combo fragility.** Must both fill the void AND find enablers. This is structural to reanimator archetypes and cannot be fully eliminated. (Acceptable)
2. **No fast-speed interaction.** Zero fast events or characters in the core plan. (Structural, not fixable without changing Stone/Ruin identity)
3. **Top-heavy curve.** Best payoffs cost 5-9. Vaultstone Harbinger at 3 helps the mid-game but doesn't fix the fundamental "need time to set up" issue. (Acceptable -- Bedrock is the intended slow archetype)
4. **Ruin competition for shared infrastructure.** Undertow still has first claim on Architect of Memory and Path to Redemption. Bedrock's improved Stone support means it's less dependent on these cards, but they remain important. (Reduced severity)

**Grade Change Rationale:** +0.4 (6.8 → 7.2). This brings Bedrock from C+ (weakest archetype, reputation risk) to B- (functional, skill-testing, not a draft trap). The gap between Bedrock and the next-weakest archetype (Depths at 7.0-7.2) closes to near-zero. Bedrock is no longer the clear floor of the format.

**This is the Ruin advocate's greatest council achievement.** The meta-argument -- that Ruin oversubscription is best solved by strengthening partner resonances, not adding more Ruin cards -- was validated by the Stone advocate's willingness to invest a Stone card slot for Bedrock's benefit.

## Final Ruin Archetype Rankings

| Archetype | Initial Grade | Final Grade | Change | Key Factor |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Cinder** | A (8.4) | A (8.4) | — | Fodder scarcity reframed as healthy constraint |
| **Undertow** | A- (8.2) | A- (8.2) | — | Already healthy; no council changes needed |
| **Eclipse** | B (7.2) | B+ (7.5*) | +0.3 | *Cartographer move to Zephyr (agreed) |
| **Bedrock** | C+ (6.8) | B- (7.2*) | +0.4 | *Vaultstone Harbinger + Roothold Keeper 1 spark (proposed) |

*Conditional grades depend on implementation of agreed/proposed changes.

### Ruin Resonance Overall Health

**Pre-Council Average: 7.65/10**
**Post-Council Average: 7.83/10** (+0.18)

The improvement is concentrated where it matters most: the bottom of the distribution. Bedrock's +0.4 and Eclipse's +0.3 close the gap between Ruin's strongest and weakest archetypes from 1.6 points (8.4 - 6.8) to 1.2 points (8.4 - 7.2). This is a healthier spread.

### The Meta-Argument: Validated

Ruin at 45 cards (ceiling) cannot solve its problems internally. The council validated the strategy of asking partner resonances to invest:
- **Zephyr** invested Dreamtide Cartographer access for Eclipse
- **Stone** invested a new card slot (Vaultstone Harbinger) for Bedrock
- **Ember** declined to invest new fodder for Cinder -- but this was the RIGHT call, as Cinder's constraint is healthy

The Ruin oversubscription problem (4 archetypes sharing one resonance) is not eliminated, but its worst consequences (Bedrock trainwrecking, Eclipse lacking cross-resonance payoffs) are addressed. The remaining draft tension -- Undertow, Eclipse, Cinder, and Bedrock competing for Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, and Reclaimer of Lost Paths -- is the kind of tension that makes draft interesting rather than frustrating.

### Priority Actions for Implementation

| # | Action | Type | Status |
|---|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | Move Dreamtide Cartographer to mono-Zephyr | Resonance reassignment | **Council agreed** |
| 2 | Fix all 7 inaccessible archetype tags | Tag corrections | **Council agreed** |
| 3 | Design & add Vaultstone Harbinger to Stone pool | New card design | **Proposed by Stone advocate** |
| 4 | Bump Roothold Keeper to 1 spark | Balance tweak | **Proposed by Stone advocate** |
| 5 | Monitor Cinder fodder balance in playtesting | Playtesting watchpoint | **Council agreed** |
| 6 | Monitor Ruin infrastructure competition in 2+ Ruin drafter pods | Playtesting watchpoint | **Council agreed** |

*End of Ruin Advocate Final Assessments -- V2 Design Council Round 10*
