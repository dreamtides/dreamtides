### Pool Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Mono-Tide | 40 |
| Mono-Ruin | 45 |
| Dual (Undertow) | 1 |
| Neutral | 24 |
| **Total Accessible** | **110** |

Of the 110 accessible cards, approximately **35-40 cards** have direct mechanical relevance to Undertow's core game plan (self-mill, void exploitation, Survivor tribal, Reclaim loops). This is an excellent core-to-pool ratio.

---

## 2. Health Ratings (1-10)

### Core Depth: 9/10

Undertow has one of the deepest cores in the format. The self-mill engine alone has multiple redundant pieces:
- **Mill sources:** Searcher in the Mists (mill 4), Flagbearer of Decay (mill 2 per Survivor), Harvest the Forgotten (mill 3), Ashborn Necromancer (abandon: mill 2), Archivist of Vanished Names (reveal-until-hit milling), Voidthorn Protector (prevent: mill 2), Abyssal Reclaimer (mill 3)
- **Void payoffs:** Abomination of Memory (spark = void count), Weight of Memory (dissolve < void count), Architect of Memory (void 7+: universal Reclaim), Soulkindler (in void: Survivors +2 spark), Tidechannel Observer (3+ void entries: 2 pts + kindle)
- **Recursion engines:** Veil of the Wastes, Twilight Reclaimer, Kindred Sparks, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Ashlight Caller, Wreckheap Survivor, Eternal Sentry
- **Survivor tribal density:** 20 Survivors in the accessible pool (19 Ruin + 1 dual), plus Boundless Wanderer as a universal type

The core is deep enough that losing 2-3 key pieces in draft does not collapse the game plan. Multiple mill sources ensure the void fills reliably, and the payoff spectrum runs from early (Weight of Memory) to late (Abomination of Memory, Path to Redemption).

Minor deduction: The archetype is *almost* too deep -- there is so much Survivor density that the tribal package can feel slightly auto-piloted in the early picks.

### Signpost Quality: 8/10

**Abyssal Reclaimer** is a well-designed signpost:
- **Clear signal:** Survivor type + mill 3 immediately communicates "this is the self-mill tribal deck."
- **Conditional retrieval:** The "if a card entered your void from another source this turn" condition is elegant. In Undertow, Flagbearer of Decay or other Survivors naturally trigger this before Abyssal Reclaimer's Materialized fires. The condition is easy to meet in-archetype but not trivially self-fulfilling.
- **Multi-archetype reach:** Usable in Eclipse (discard fills void first), and Mirage (as a flicker target that mills 3 each time).
- **Appropriate power level:** A 3-cost 1-spark body that mills 3 and conditionally retrieves is strong but not format-warping.

The one weakness is that the signpost is *subtle*. A new player seeing "mill 3 and maybe retrieve" might not immediately understand the void-volume scaling payoffs that make this powerful. Compared to Forgeborn Martyr ("Warriors +1 spark" -- instantly legible) or Ashfire Ritualist (kindle + sacrifice loop -- obviously powerful), Abyssal Reclaimer requires understanding of the supporting cast to appreciate. This is appropriate for an uncommon signpost, but it does mean draft signal clarity depends on supporting cards more than the signpost itself.

### Mechanical Coherence: 9/10

Undertow's mechanics are exceptionally well-integrated. Nearly every card in the core serves multiple roles:

1. **Mill feeds payoffs feeds recursion feeds more mill:** Flagbearer of Decay mills 2 per Survivor played -> Abomination of Memory grows -> Architect of Memory unlocks universal Reclaim -> Reclaimed Survivors trigger more mill.
2. **Survivor dissolved triggers create value from losses:** Seer of the Fallen, Silent Avenger, Twilight Reclaimer, and Dustborn Veteran all convert Survivor deaths into card advantage, spark, or recursion. This means opponents face a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't dynamic.
3. **Void velocity vs. void volume:** Tidechannel Observer (3+ void entries per turn) and Abomination of Memory (total void count) reward the same engine from different angles, creating layered payoffs.
4. **Soulkindler is the hidden gem:** A 2-cost Survivor that becomes a passive +2 spark anthem from the void. You *want* it milled or dissolved, not on the battlefield. This inverts normal card evaluation in a way that is deeply thematic.

The only minor incoherence: some of the Ruin discard-payoff cards (Pattern Seeker, Apocalypse Vigilante, Mother of Flames, Forgotten Titan, Torchbearer of the Abyss) are mechanically Eclipse-oriented rather than Undertow-oriented. They coexist in the pool but do not synergize with the self-mill plan unless you build a hybrid. This is not a flaw -- it is intentional overlap that enables Build #2 below.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 7/10

This is Undertow's weakest axis, though still above average.

**Strengths:**
- Survivor typing is a clean tribal signal. When you see Survivors flowing, you know Undertow or Cinder is open.
- Self-mill cards (Harvest the Forgotten, Searcher in the Mists, Flagbearer of Decay) are useless in most other archetypes, so they table well. This rewards correct reading.
- Weight of Memory, Through the Rift, and Abomination of Memory are virtually unplayable outside Undertow, making them excellent late-round signals.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Ruin is shared by 4 archetypes** (Undertow, Eclipse, Cinder, Bedrock). Many strong Ruin cards (Architect of Memory, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Path to Redemption) are competed for across all four. A drafter cannot distinguish "Ruin is open" from "Undertow is open" early.
- **Survivors appear in Cinder** (Sunset Chronicler, Dustborn Veteran, Resilient Wanderer) and **Eclipse** (Duneveil Vanguard, Emberwatch Veteran). Survivor-matters cards can be contested by non-Undertow Ruin decks that splash Survivors.
- **Tide half is mostly generic** -- Prevent events, draw spells, and value bodies. These are equally wanted by Depths, Tempest, and Mirage. Undertow's specific Tide needs (Harvest the Forgotten, Reunion, Guiding Light, Archivist of Vanished Names) are narrow enough to signal correctly, but the overall Tide package does not obviously telegraph "I am drafting Undertow."

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 8/10

Undertow supports multiple viable configurations (see Section 4 below), and the large accessible pool (110 cards) provides significant draft pivot options.

**Flex points:**
- The prevent suite (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Cragfall, etc.) can be scaled up or down depending on whether you want a more controlling or more aggressive build.
- Reclaim density is tunable -- from minimal (just Kindred Sparks + Reunion) to maximal (full Architect of Memory engine).
- The Survivor count can flex from 8-10 (lean tribal) to 14-16 (deep tribal) depending on availability.
- Non-Survivor Ruin cards (Revenant of the Lost, Titan of Forgotten Echoes, Risen Champion) provide void-only finishers that do not require Survivor density.

**Constraints:**
- You *must* draft mill sources. Without at least 3-4 mill cards, the void does not fill fast enough for payoffs to come online. This is a real deckbuilding constraint.
- Soulkindler is near-irreplaceable. It is the only passive void-based anthem, and without it, Survivor spark values are underwhelming.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### Hidden Gem #1: Starlit Cascade (Tide, 1 energy)
*"Until end of turn, when an ally leaves play, gain 2 energy."*

Primarily designed for Mirage (flicker triggers), this card becomes excellent in Undertow when Survivors are getting dissolved. Each dissolved Survivor generates 2 energy, which funds Kindred Sparks from void (1 energy), Resilient Wanderer's return (1 energy), or Wreckheap Survivor's Judgment return (1 energy). Against an opponent who resolves Burst of Obliteration, your low-spark Survivors each grant 2 energy on death, turning a board wipe into a massive energy injection for rebuilding from void. Particularly strong with Seer of the Fallen and Twilight Reclaimer already triggering on Survivor dissolution.

### Hidden Gem #2: Nexus of Passing (Neutral, 4 energy)
*"Spark = battlefield transitions this turn, up to 8."*

Not obviously an Undertow card, but Undertow generates significant battlefield transitions through a different mechanism than Mirage's flicker. Reclaiming and re-materializing Survivors from void means cards are constantly entering the battlefield. With Kindred Sparks (enters from void), Veil of the Wastes (Reclaims self when you materialize a Survivor), and the Architect of Memory engine online, a single turn can see 4-6 battlefield entries. At 4-6 spark for 4 energy, this outperforms most dedicated finishers and does not require any Survivor typing.

### Hidden Gem #3: Celestial Reverie (Tide, 1 energy)
*"Until end of turn, when you play a character, draw 1."*

Undertow's late-game involves playing multiple cheap Survivors from void via Reclaim. With Architect of Memory online (void 7+: all cards have Reclaim), each Reclaimed Survivor is a "play a character" trigger. Celestial Reverie for 1 energy turns a Reclaim chain into a draw engine: play Flagbearer of Decay from void (draw 1, mill 2), play Kindred Sparks from void (draw 1), play Searcher in the Mists from void (draw 1, mill 4). Three Survivors played = 3 cards drawn for 1 energy investment. This converts the Reclaim endgame from "replay your board" to "replay your board while refueling your hand."

---

## 4. Two Different Ways to Build Undertow

### Build A: "Survivor Swarm" (Tribal Aggro-Midrange)

**Core identity:** Go wide with cheap Survivors, exploit tribal synergies, use Soulkindler from the void as a passive anthem. Win through spark accumulation on a board full of +2 spark Survivors.

**Key cards (15-18 card core):**
- Mill engine: Flagbearer of Decay, Searcher in the Mists, Harvest the Forgotten
- Tribal payoffs: Hope's Vanguard (draw engine), Soulkindler (void anthem), Kindred Sparks (cheap from void/hand)
- Recursion: Veil of the Wastes, Twilight Reclaimer, Resilient Wanderer
- Signpost: Abyssal Reclaimer
- Tutor: Through the Rift
- Dissolved value: Seer of the Fallen, Silent Avenger

**Game plan:** Deploy cheap Survivors early. Flagbearer of Decay mills 2 each time. Soulkindler gets milled or deployed then dissolved, granting Survivors +2 spark from the void. Hope's Vanguard draws cards with 2+ Survivors in play. Opponents who kill Survivors trigger Seer of the Fallen (draw), Silent Avenger (kindle), Twilight Reclaimer (Reclaim another Survivor). Win through relentless board presence with buffed spark values.

**Tide cards used:** Harvest the Forgotten (mill+draw), Reunion (retrieve+draw), Guiding Light (foresee+draw+reclaim), Celestial Reverie (draw on character plays), minimal prevent suite.

**Strengths:** Very consistent; many redundant pieces. Resilient against removal. Comes online fast (turn 2-3 mill, turn 4-5 tribal density).
**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to Soulflame Predator (banishes void, neutralizing Soulkindler), Ruin Scavenger, and exile-based removal. Low individual card power -- relies on density.

### Build B: "Void Engine" (Control-Combo)

**Core identity:** Fill the void to 7+ cards, unlock Architect of Memory's universal Reclaim, then replay a curated selection of high-impact cards from void repeatedly. Win through Abomination of Memory (spark = void) or Tidechannel Observer (void velocity points).

**Key cards (15-18 card core):**
- Mill engine: Searcher in the Mists, Harvest the Forgotten, Archivist of Vanished Names, Ashborn Necromancer
- Void-volume payoffs: Abomination of Memory, Weight of Memory, Architect of Memory
- Velocity payoff: Tidechannel Observer
- Recursion: Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Ashlight Caller
- Big finishers: Revenant of the Lost (void-only 6 spark), Titan of Forgotten Echoes (Reclaim engine)

**Game plan:** Use Tide's prevent suite to survive the early game. Mill aggressively with Searcher in the Mists and Archivist of Vanished Names. Reach void 7+ to unlock Architect of Memory. Weight of Memory becomes unconditional removal. Abomination of Memory becomes a 10-15 spark body. Reclaim high-impact events and characters at will. Tidechannel Observer converts void velocity into direct points and kindle.

**Tide cards used:** Full prevent suite (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Cragfall, Together Against the Tide), draw/filtering (Frost Visionary, Looming Oracle), Archivist of Vanished Names, Duskwatch Vigil (prevent trigger tempo).

**Strengths:** Enormous late-game inevitability. Abomination of Memory scales without limit. Universal Reclaim means every card in void is live. Weight of Memory becomes premium removal.
**Weaknesses:** Slow setup; vulnerable to aggro before void 7+. Architect of Memory is a rare that may not appear in draft. Void-banish effects (Soulflame Predator, Ruin Scavenger, Eclipse Herald) are devastating.

---

## 5. Remaining Problems

### Problem 1: Void-Banish Vulnerability (Moderate)

Undertow's entire game plan is invalidated by void-banish effects. Three cards in the format directly banish the opponent's void:
- **Soulflame Predator** (Zephyr, Fast Character): Materialized: Banish opponent's void. This is *catastrophic* -- a single activation deletes Soulkindler's anthem, Architect of Memory's threshold, Abomination of Memory's spark, and all Reclaim targets.
- **Ruin Scavenger** (Neutral): Judgment: Banish 1 from opponent's void to gain 1 energy. Less devastating but repeatable.
- **Spirit Field Reclaimer** (Stone): Judgment: Pay 1 to kindle 1 and banish 1 from opponent's void.

There is no in-archetype way to protect the void. Tide's prevent suite can counter characters (Cragfall prevents Soulflame Predator), but Ruin Scavenger is Neutral and widely available. This is a fundamental strategic vulnerability that keeps Undertow honest -- which is good design -- but makes the Soulflame Predator matchup feel unwinnable if it resolves.

**Severity:** Moderate. Soulflame Predator is a Zephyr uncommon, so it does not appear in every draft, and Undertow has access to Prevents to counter it. But when it resolves, the impact is disproportionate.

### Problem 2: Over-Reliance on Soulkindler for Spark Competitiveness (Moderate)

In Build A (Survivor Swarm), the Survivor bodies are almost all 1-spark characters. Without Soulkindler in the void granting +2 spark, Undertow's board of 1-spark Survivors struggles to compete on points against Basalt's Spirit Animals, Crucible's Warriors, or even Mirage's flicker-boosted bodies.

Soulkindler is a single uncommon that must be drafted *and* placed in the void (not always trivial -- sometimes it is stuck in hand). If Soulkindler is not available in the draft, Build A's point generation becomes questionable, pushing the drafter toward Build B.

Other spark sources exist (Silent Avenger's kindle 2, Tidechannel Observer's kindle 1 + 2 points), but they are more conditional. The archetype would benefit from a second "Survivors care about void" payoff that provides spark scaling.

**Severity:** Moderate. Soulkindler is uncommon (not rare), so it appears frequently. And Build B (Void Engine) has Abomination of Memory as an alternative finisher. But losing Soulkindler meaningfully narrows viable builds.

### Problem 3: Mana Curve Skews Heavy in Ruin (Minor)

Looking at the Survivor Ruin package specifically: Kindred Sparks (5), Sunset Chronicler (4), Reclaimer of Lost Paths (4), Eternal Sentry (4), Ashborn Necromancer (4), Abomination of Memory (5), Path to Redemption (6). Many of the most impactful Ruin cards cost 4-6 energy. The cheap Survivors (Flagbearer of Decay 2, Searcher in the Mists 2, Seer of the Fallen 2, Twilight Reclaimer 1, Hope's Vanguard 2, Resilient Wanderer 2) are critical for early game but have limited individual impact.

Undertow lacks a strong energy generation engine. Tide has no dedicated energy ramp. Ruin has no dedicated energy ramp. The neutral pool offers Arc Gate Opening and Glimpse of Infinity, but those are contested. This means Undertow often cannot deploy a 5-cost payoff and a cheap Survivor on the same turn, slowing the engine's velocity.

**Severity:** Minor. Kindred Sparks' "play for 1 with an allied Survivor" largely solves this for its most important expensive card. And Build A's cheap Survivor curve naturally avoids the heaviest costs.

### Problem 4: Lack of Proactive Scoring Without Board Presence (Minor)

If Undertow's board gets swept (Apocalypse, Burst of Obliteration), the archetype has no way to score points without re-establishing characters. Tidechannel Observer and Soulkindler both require surviving a Judgment phase. Unlike Tempest (which can play events for direct points via Illumination of Glory) or Cinder (which scores via Fathomless Maw and The Forsaker from sacrifice triggers), Undertow's points come exclusively from spark on Survivors (amplified by Soulkindler) and Tidechannel Observer's conditional 2 points.

The archetype's resilience to board wipes comes from recursion (Reclaim the Survivors back), not from off-board scoring. This is thematically appropriate but can lead to tempo losses.

**Severity:** Minor. Recursion is fast enough (Veil of the Wastes, Kindred Sparks for 1) that rebuilding after a wipe is realistic. And Survivor dissolved triggers (Seer of the Fallen, Silent Avenger, Twilight Reclaimer) generate value even from board wipes.

## Summary

| Axis | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Core Depth | 9/10 | Deep, redundant mill + payoff + recursion package |
| Signpost Quality | 8/10 | Well-designed conditional signpost; slightly subtle for newer players |
| Mechanical Coherence | 9/10 | Mill-payoff-recursion loop is exceptionally well-integrated |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 7/10 | Ruin shared by 4 archetypes; generic Tide package; but mill cards signal cleanly |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 8/10 | Two distinct builds (Tribal Swarm vs. Void Engine); tunable prevent and Reclaim density |
| **Overall** | **8.2/10** | One of the strongest and most mechanically cohesive archetypes in the format |

Undertow is a well-realized archetype with deep synergy layers, multiple viable builds, and clear mechanical identity. Its main risk is the binary nature of its void-banish vulnerability and its moderate dependence on Soulkindler for the tribal build's competitiveness. The v2 additions -- Abyssal Reclaimer (signpost), Tidechannel Observer (void velocity scoring), Archivist of Vanished Names (tutor + incidental mill), and Voidthorn Protector (prevent-mill bridge) -- each address distinct needs without creating redundancy. Undertow enters v2 as one of the format's healthiest archetypes.
