# V2 DEFINITIVE Master Allocation — Post-Council Round 10

## Overview

This is the **final, authoritative** allocation for Dreamtides' v2 resonance system, incorporating all consensus decisions from the five-advocate Design Council (Tide, Zephyr, Stone, Ember, Ruin) across Round 10.

**Total card count: 222 existing + 27 new = 249 cards.**
- 25 original v2 new cards
- 2 additional council-created cards (Smolder Sprite, Vaultstone Harbinger)

**Exactly 10 dual-resonance cards** (one per archetype pair). All other cards are mono-resonance or neutral.

## Change Log from Round 7 Allocation

### Three-Way Trade (Council Consensus)

| Change | From | To | Count Impact |
|--------|------|----|-------------|
| Dreamtide Cartographer | mono-Tide | mono-Zephyr | Tide 40→39→40*, Zephyr 43→44 |
| Data Pulse | mono-Ember | mono-Tide | Tide 39→40, Ember 45→44→45* |
| Smolder Sprite (NEW) | — | mono-Ember | Ember 44→45 |

*Net: Tide 40→40, Zephyr 43→44, Ember 45→45.

### New Card: Smolder Sprite

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 1 energy |
| Type | Character |
| Subtype | Survivor |
| Spark | 0 |
| Rarity | Common |
| Resonance | Ember |
| Primary Archetypes | Cinder, Gale |
| Ability | Materialized: Materialize a figment. Abandon this character: Kindle 1. |

**Rationale:** Addresses Cinder's cheap-fodder gap (2 bodies for 1 energy) and Gale's need for fast deploy bodies. Also serves Crucible (non-Warrior sacrifice fodder) and Tempest (cheap card-play trigger).

### New Card: Vaultstone Harbinger

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 3 energy |
| Type | Character |
| Subtype | Ancient |
| Spark | 1 |
| Rarity | Uncommon |
| Resonance | Stone |
| Primary Archetypes | Bedrock, Depths |
| Ability | When you materialize a character from your void, gain 2 energy. Judgment: If a card entered your void this turn, kindle 1. |

**Rationale:** Second Stone-Bedrock bridge (previously only Deepvault Keeper). The void-materialize energy refund directly funds more Reclaim plays. The Judgment kindle with void-entry condition rewards both mill and recursion. Addresses Bedrock's 6/10 mechanical coherence (lowest in format).

### Roothold Keeper Stat Change

| Property | Old | New |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Spark | 0 | 1 |

**Rationale:** Every other signpost contributes to Judgment scoring. At 0 spark, Roothold Keeper was pure engine with zero scoring contribution despite requiring void-only setup. At 1 spark, it matches format standards for a 2-cost restricted body.

### Starcatcher Archetype Retag

| Property | Old | New |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Primary Archetypes | Tempest, Basalt | Depths, Basalt |

**Rationale:** Starcatcher is mono-Stone. Tempest (Tide+Ember) cannot access Stone cards. The "Tempest" tag was a documented error. Depths (Tide+Stone) CAN access it, and "when you play event, gain 1 energy" synergizes with Depths' event-heavy control plan. Tempest absorbs the loss with 9/10 core depth.

### Inaccessible Archetype Tag Corrections (7 Cards)

| Card | Resonance | Old Tags | Corrected Tags | Error Fixed |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Starcatcher | Stone | Tempest, Basalt | Depths, Basalt | Tempest can't access Stone |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Tide | Depths, Gale, Tempest | Depths, Tempest | Gale can't access Tide |
| Voidthorn Protector | Ruin | Depths, Gale, Cinder | Depths, Cinder | Gale can't access Ruin |
| Ashen Threshold | Ember | Mirage, Cinder, Bedrock | Mirage, Cinder | Bedrock can't access Ember |
| Kindlespark Harvester | Stone | Crucible, Cinder, Depths | Crucible, Depths | Cinder can't access Stone |
| Shadowpaw | Ruin | Mirage, Basalt | Undertow, Bedrock | Mirage/Basalt can't access Ruin |
| Ashlight Caller | Ruin | Tempest, Undertow | Undertow | Tempest can't access Ruin |

### Dreamtide Cartographer Tags (Updated for Zephyr Move)

| Property | Old (Tide) | New (Zephyr) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Resonance | Tide | Zephyr |
| Primary Archetypes | Gale, Tempest, Eclipse | Gale, Eclipse, Mirage |

### Data Pulse Tags (Updated for Tide Move)

| Property | Old (Ember) | New (Tide) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Resonance | Ember | Tide |
| Primary Archetypes | Tempest | Tempest, Mirage, Undertow, Depths |

## Final Archetype Grades (Council Consensus)

| Rank | Archetype | Pair | Final Grade | R7 Grade | Δ | Key Factor |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|----------|---|-----------|
| 1 | **Cinder** | Ember+Ruin | A (8.4) | A (8.4) | — | Format-leading sacrifice engine; fodder scarcity is healthy constraint |
| 2 | **Mirage** | Tide+Zephyr | A- (8.2) | A- (8.2) | — | Tightest mechanical coherence; two distinct flicker builds |
| 3 | **Undertow** | Tide+Ruin | A- (8.2) | A- (8.2) | — | Deepest core; Tidechannel Observer is breakout innovation |
| 4 | **Tempest** | Tide+Ember | A- (8.1) | A- (8.2) | -0.1 | Starcatcher loss absorbed; homogeneity problem solved |
| 5 | **Basalt** | Zephyr+Stone | B+ (7.8) | B+ (7.8) | — | Deep tribal; monitor auto-build in playtesting |
| 6 | **Crucible** | Stone+Ember | B+ (7.6) | B+ (7.6) | — | Best-executed v2 fix: rails 9→6 via purity-vs-power tension |
| 7 | **Gale** | Zephyr+Ember | B+ (7.6) | B (7.2) | +0.4 | Cartographer move + Smolder Sprite fix accessibility gap |
| 8 | **Eclipse** | Zephyr+Ruin | B+ (7.5) | B (7.2) | +0.3 | Cartographer access; Voidthread Weaver engine is real |
| 9 | **Depths** | Tide+Stone | B (7.2) | B- (7.0) | +0.2 | Starcatcher retag + Vaultstone Harbinger improve Stone bridge |
| 10 | **Bedrock** | Stone+Ruin | B- (7.2) | C+ (6.8) | +0.4 | Vaultstone Harbinger doubles Stone-void bridges; Roothold Keeper scores |

**Format health range:** 7.2–8.4 (spread: 1.2 points).
**R7 range was:** 6.8–8.4 (spread: 1.6 points).
**Improvement:** Bottom raised from C+ (6.8) to B- (7.2). No archetype below B-. Spread compressed by 25%.

**Average archetype grade:** 7.78/10 (up from 7.66/10 in R7).

## Summary of All Changes from Round 7

### Resonance Reassignments (2 cards)

| Card | From | To | Reason |
|------|------|----|--------|
| Dreamtide Cartographer | mono-Tide | mono-Zephyr | Hand-emptying draw is Zephyr-coded; fixes Gale/Eclipse accessibility |
| Data Pulse | mono-Ember | mono-Tide | Compensates Tide for Cartographer loss; generic utility cantrip |

### New Cards Added (2 cards)

| Card | Resonance | Primary Purpose |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Smolder Sprite | Ember | Cheap sacrifice fodder for Cinder; fast body for Gale |
| Vaultstone Harbinger | Stone | Second Stone-Bedrock void bridge; raises Bedrock coherence |

### Stat Changes (1 card)

| Card | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Roothold Keeper | Spark 0→1 | All other signposts score; 2-cost void-only body deserves 1 spark |

### Tag Corrections (8 cards)

| Card | Old Tags | New Tags |
|------|----------|----------|
| Starcatcher | Tempest, Basalt | Depths, Basalt |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Depths, Gale, Tempest | Depths, Tempest |
| Voidthorn Protector | Depths, Gale, Cinder | Depths, Cinder |
| Ashen Threshold | Mirage, Cinder, Bedrock | Mirage, Cinder |
| Kindlespark Harvester | Crucible, Cinder, Depths | Crucible, Depths |
| Dreamtide Cartographer | Gale, Tempest, Eclipse | Gale, Eclipse, Mirage |
| Shadowpaw | Mirage, Basalt | Undertow, Bedrock |
| Ashlight Caller | Tempest, Undertow | Undertow |

### Playtesting Watchpoints (Council Consensus)

1. **Cinder fodder balance:** Does Smolder Sprite adequately raise Cinder's floor?
2. **Gale Musician availability:** Are 2+ Musicians consistently available?
3. **Basalt auto-build:** Are Basalt decks too homogeneous?
4. **Crucible Build B viability:** Is Judgment Engine competitive with Warrior Phalanx?
5. **Bedrock Vaultstone Harbinger impact:** Does the second bridge meaningfully improve coherence?
6. **Ruin infrastructure contention:** Are Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths creating unhealthy pinch points in 2+ Ruin drafter pods?
7. **Depths effective pool:** With Starcatcher retagged and Vaultstone Harbinger, does Depths' Stone half feel deeper?
8. **Tempest Legendary variance:** How much do Epiphany Unfolded and Moment Rewound swing outcomes?
