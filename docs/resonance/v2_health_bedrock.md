# V2 Archetype Health Check: Bedrock (Stone+Ruin) -- Reanimator / Cheat into Play

---

## 1. Complete Accessible Card Pool

Bedrock's accessible pool = mono-Stone (40) + mono-Ruin (45) + Bedrock dual signpost (1) + Neutral (24) = **110 cards total**.

This is a massive improvement over v1's 23-card core. The jump from 23 to 110 accessible cards represents the v2 structural change: Bedrock now has full access to both mono-resonance pools instead of relying on a thin set of dual/tagged cards.

## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth: 7/10

Bedrock's core identity -- cheating expensive characters into play from the void -- has genuine depth in v2. The archetype has multiple reanimation targets at different cost points:

- **Budget:** Roothold Keeper (2-cost, self-funding), Risen Champion (4-cost Warrior, chain-reclaims)
- **Mid-range:** Revenant of the Lost (3-cost, 6 spark -- the poster child), Ashen Avenger (3-cost, self-reclaiming Warrior)
- **Top-end:** Titan of Forgotten Echoes (6-cost, 4 spark, self-reclaiming), The Rising God (9-cost, 6 spark), The Devourer (8-cost, 8 spark)

The enabler suite is also multi-layered: Deepvault Keeper (cost reduction), Architect of Memory (mass Reclaim at 7+ void), Reclaimer of Lost Paths (targeted Reclaim 0), Path to Redemption (mass Reclaim), Speaker for the Forgotten (Warrior-triggered Reclaim). However, the archetype still relies heavily on getting specific cards into the void AND finding the enablers to retrieve them, which creates a two-piece combo dependency that can be fragile.

### Signpost Quality: 7/10

Roothold Keeper is a well-designed signpost that clearly communicates "draft void-only characters." At 2-cost, it is cheap enough to deploy early from the void, and the gain-1-energy + draw-1 partially self-funds while replacing itself. It pairs directly with Deepvault Keeper (characters from void cost 1 less), creating a net-0 energy, cantripping creature from void -- an elegant economic engine.

The limitation: Roothold Keeper is a 0-spark body, so it contributes nothing to scoring by itself. It is an engine piece, not a payoff. The actual payoffs (Revenant of the Lost at 6 spark, Titan at 4 spark, The Devourer at 8 spark) are spread across the mono-Ruin pool without a dual-resonance banner. This means the signpost says "play from void" but does not itself demonstrate why that is powerful -- the drafter must already understand the archetype's ceiling.

### Mechanical Coherence: 6/10

This is Bedrock's weakest dimension. The archetype pulls from two very different mono pools:

- **Stone** provides ramp, Warriors, Spirit Animals, Judgment triggers, hand disruption, and the new "anchor effect" (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden). Most of Stone's identity has nothing to do with void play.
- **Ruin** provides void interaction, Survivors, mill, discard payoffs, and Reclaim. This is where Bedrock's identity lives.

The overlap zone is narrow: Speaker for the Forgotten (play Warrior: Reclaim), Deepvault Keeper (void cost reduction), The Waking Titan (bounces ally, draws from Judgment), Nexus Wayfinder (cost reduction), and Virtuoso of Harmony (energy ramp). Many Stone cards (Warrior tribal lords, Spirit Animal tribal, hand disruption) do not connect to the reanimator plan at all, meaning a Bedrock drafter must navigate a large pool where much of Stone is "off-plan" filler rather than synergistic pieces.

Ruin's internal coherence for Bedrock is much stronger -- Reclaim effects, void-volume payoffs, and expensive reanimation targets form a clear cluster. But the Survivor tribal axis (which dominates Ruin's card count) is largely irrelevant to Bedrock's core plan unless the drafter deliberately splashes a Survivor sub-package.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 7/10

The void-only mechanic is an unambiguous draft signal: Roothold Keeper, Revenant of the Lost, Risen Champion, and The Devourer all say "you may only play this from your void" (or equivalent), and these cards are nearly useless outside of archetypes that can reliably fill the void. This creates clean signaling -- if you see Revenant of the Lost late, Bedrock is open.

Deepvault Keeper ("characters from void cost 1 less") is another clean signal: it has no purpose outside of void-play strategies. Similarly, Architect of Memory's "void 7+: all cards have Reclaim = cost" is a loud Bedrock/Undertow signal.

The weakness: Because Bedrock's key cards are spread across Stone and Ruin mono pools, a Bedrock drafter is competing with Crucible/Basalt/Depths for Stone cards and with Undertow/Eclipse/Cinder for Ruin cards. There are very few cards that only Bedrock wants -- most Ruin Reclaim effects are also desirable for Undertow.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 7/10

Bedrock offers more build diversity than in v1, with several distinct approaches:

1. **Pure Reanimator:** Focus on getting expensive bodies (Revenant, Titan, The Rising God, The Devourer) into the void and cheating them back. Enablers: Architect of Memory, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Path to Redemption, Deepvault Keeper.

2. **Warrior Recursion:** Lean into Stone Warriors that can recur from the void. Ashen Avenger, Risen Champion, Speaker for the Forgotten create a Warrior death-and-rebirth loop. Bridge to Crucible.

3. **Value Grind:** Use Roothold Keeper, Starsea Traveler, and Scrap Reclaimer as repeatable value engines, grinding out advantage over time. Pair with Stone's energy ramp and hand disruption (Break the Veil, Lurking Dread) for a grindy control approach.

This is a meaningful improvement over v1 where Bedrock was essentially "get Revenant of the Lost into void or lose."

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Virtuoso of Harmony (Stone, 2 energy, 2 spark, Musician)
*End of turn: gain 2 energy.*

Listed as Depths/Bedrock in the allocation. This unassuming 2-drop is one of Bedrock's most important cards. The reanimator plan is energy-hungry: Revenant of the Lost costs 3 from void (2 with Deepvault Keeper), Titan of Forgotten Echoes costs 6, Path to Redemption costs 6. Virtuoso provides 2 guaranteed energy every turn while carrying 2 spark -- a real clock. In a Bedrock shell that wants to ramp to expensive Reclaim plays, this is the glue card that funds the entire operation. Often mistaken for a "Depths card" and overlooked by Bedrock drafters.

### 2. Shadowpaw (Ruin, 3 energy, Spirit Animal, 1 spark)
*Materialized: Return a character from your void to your hand.*

Classified as Mirage/Basalt, Shadowpaw looks like a flicker payoff card. But in Bedrock, it is a reliable void retrieval engine that does not require the complex Reclaim keyword or threshold conditions -- it simply returns a character to hand. This means it can fetch Revenant of the Lost (which still plays from void, but you can also mill it again for repeated use), or more importantly it can retrieve non-void-only bodies that were milled or abandoned. The Spirit Animal typing is irrelevant for Bedrock, but the raw effect -- repeatable void retrieval on a body -- is exactly what the archetype needs.

### 3. Ashen Threshold (Ember, 3 energy, Outsider, 1 spark)
*Ally leaves play: gain 1 energy. Once per turn, when you materialize from void: draw 1.*

This is a mono-Ember card that Bedrock cannot naturally access (it requires splashing into a third resonance or getting lucky with neutral/dual bridges). However, it is tagged with Bedrock as a primary archetype in the allocation, and if the draft environment allows off-resonance splashing or the card wheels due to Ember-Ruin drafters passing it, it is extraordinary for Bedrock. The "materialize from void: draw 1" trigger fires on every Reclaim play, turning Bedrock's core plan into a card advantage engine. The "ally leaves play: gain 1 energy" adds fuel whenever creatures are sacrificed or bounced. This card single-handedly solves Bedrock's two biggest problems: card advantage and energy.

**Important caveat:** Ashen Threshold is mono-Ember, so Bedrock can only access it if the draft/deckbuilding rules allow off-resonance picks, or if there is some bridge mechanism not documented here. If strictly limited to Stone+Ruin+Neutral+dual, this card is inaccessible. In that case, the third gem would instead be:

### 3 (alternate). Scrap Reclaimer (Ruin, 4 energy, Tinkerer, 0 spark)
*Judgment: Return this character from your void to your hand.*

A self-recurring body that bounces itself back to hand every Judgment phase. In Bedrock, this provides: (a) a body that is always available to replay from hand as sacrifice fodder, (b) a trigger for "play from void" effects if it enters the void between Judgments, (c) reliable Titan of Forgotten Echoes fuel (counts as one of the 2 cards played per turn). The 0 spark is deceptive -- this card's value is entirely in its inevitability. Over a long game, it generates enormous cumulative advantage.

---

## 4. Two Different Builds

### Build A: "The Crypt Engine" (Pure Reanimator)

**Strategy:** Fill the void with expensive bodies, then mass-reclaim them for devastating board states. Win through overwhelming spark totals from undercosted reanimation targets.

**Key Cards:**
- **Payoffs:** Revenant of the Lost (3-cost 6 spark from void), Titan of Forgotten Echoes (6-cost 4 spark, self-reclaiming), The Devourer (8-cost 8 spark with void banish), Risen Champion (4-cost 2 spark void-only Warrior), Roothold Keeper (2-cost cantrip from void)
- **Enablers:** Architect of Memory (void 7+ = mass Reclaim), Deepvault Keeper (void characters cost 1 less), Reclaimer of Lost Paths (targeted Reclaim 0 for cost 3 or less), Path to Redemption (mass Reclaim)
- **Void-fillers:** Searcher in the Mists (mill 4), Flagbearer of Decay (mill 2 per Survivor), Ashborn Necromancer (abandon ally: mill 2), Reunion (return void character to hand + draw)
- **Ramp:** Virtuoso of Harmony (2 energy/turn), Nexus Wayfinder (characters cost 2 less), Arc Gate Opening (gain 4 energy), Glimpse of Infinity (gain 3 energy)
- **Removal:** Weight of Memory (dissolve enemy cost < void count -- trivially large in this build), Abyssal Plunge, Scorched Reckoning

**Win condition:** By mid-game, void reaches 7+ cards, activating Architect of Memory. Every card in void now has Reclaim = cost. Deploy Revenant of the Lost for 3 energy (2 with Deepvault Keeper) as a 6-spark body. Titan self-reclaims after playing 2 cards. The Devourer provides a game-ending 8 spark if void reaches 8+, though banishing the void is a real cost. Weight of Memory becomes premium removal as void grows.

**Weakness:** Extremely setup-dependent. If Architect of Memory is removed or never found, the deck lacks a mass-enabler. Aggressive decks (Gale, Crucible) can end the game before the reanimation engine comes online.

### Build B: "Warrior Undying" (Warrior Recursion Midrange)

**Strategy:** Deploy Stone Warriors that generate value, use Ruin recursion to ensure they never truly die. Grind opponents out through persistent board presence and incremental advantage.

**Key Cards:**
- **Warriors:** Seeker for the Way (Materialized: draw Warrior), Skyflame Commander (+1 spark to Warriors), Blade of Unity (spark = Warrior count), Ashen Avenger (self-reclaims for 2 energy + banish void card), Risen Champion (void-only, dissolved: reclaim different Warrior), Stoneheart Veteran (Judgment: pay 3 to kindle 2)
- **Warrior Bridges:** Speaker for the Forgotten (play Warrior: Reclaim random cost 3 or less), Forgeborn Martyr (dual Stone+Ember -- NOT accessible to Bedrock), Invoker of Myths (materialize Warrior: draw 1)
- **Recursion Package:** Wreckheap Survivor (Judgment: pay 1 to return from void), Scrap Reclaimer (Judgment: return self from void), Dustborn Veteran (ally dissolved: Reclaim 1 this turn), Roothold Keeper (void cantrip)
- **Ramp:** Dawnblade Wanderer (2 energy/Judgment), Bloomweaver (1 energy per character materialized), Ethereal Trailblazer (1 energy/Judgment), Wolfbond Chieftain (1 energy/Judgment with 2+ Warriors)
- **Hand Disruption:** Break the Veil, Lurking Dread (proactive disruption from Stone)

**Win condition:** Build a wide Warrior board that scores through Blade of Unity and Skyflame Commander pumps. When opponents dissolve your Warriors, Dustborn Veteran reclaims them, Risen Champion chains to another Warrior, and Ashen Avenger returns itself. Speaker for the Forgotten triggers Reclaim on every Warrior play. The board regenerates faster than the opponent can remove it.

**Weakness:** Lower ceiling than Build A. Requires significant Warrior density from Stone, competing directly with Crucible drafters. The Warrior package works better with Ember access (Forgeborn Martyr, Dreadcall Warden, Fury of the Clan) -- pure Stone+Ruin Warriors lack the explosive Crucible payoffs.

---

## 5. Problem Flags

### Problem 1: Stone Pool Mismatch -- Most of Stone Is Irrelevant to Bedrock

While the accessible pool is now 110 cards, this number is misleading. Of Stone's 40 mono cards:

- **~12 Warrior tribal cards** are only useful if building the Warrior Recursion variant, and even then they compete with Crucible.
- **~7 Spirit Animal cards** have essentially zero synergy with Bedrock's void-play identity. Ghostlight Wolves, Dawnprowler Panther, Luminwings, etc. are pure Basalt cards that happen to share a resonance.
- **~5 new Stone cards** are designed for Crucible/Basalt/Depths (Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit, Ironbark Warden, Everhold Protector, Kindlespark Harvester). Only Deepvault Keeper and arguably Stoneheart Veteran serve Bedrock directly.

**Effective Stone contribution to Bedrock core plan:** approximately 10-15 cards out of 40 (Deepvault Keeper, Nexus Wayfinder, Speaker for the Forgotten, The Waking Titan, Virtuoso of Harmony, energy ramp pieces, hand disruption). The rest is noise.

**Verdict:** The Stone deficit fix helps Bedrock only marginally. Of the 7 new Stone cards, only 1 (Deepvault Keeper) is a direct Bedrock enabler. The Stone pool increase from 31 to 40 primarily benefits Crucible and Basalt, not Bedrock.

### Problem 2: Ruin Competition -- Undertow Wants the Same Cards

Bedrock and Undertow both live in Ruin's Reclaim/void space. The key Ruin cards for Bedrock (Architect of Memory, Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Path to Redemption, Revenant of the Lost, Titan of Forgotten Echoes) are also strong in Undertow. In a draft where both archetypes are being contested, Bedrock gets squeezed because:

- Undertow has Tide access (draw, Prevent, information control) as a robust second color
- Bedrock's Stone access provides less directly synergistic support
- The Reclaim enablers are shared, but Undertow can function without the big reanimation targets while Bedrock cannot

This means Bedrock is the "second-best" Ruin void archetype in contested drafts. The Tidechannel Observer (new Ruin card) even explicitly differentiates: "void velocity" (3+ entries per turn) favors Undertow/Eclipse/Cinder, not Bedrock, which tends to make a few big void plays per game rather than many small ones.

### Problem 3: Event Density in Stone+Ruin Is Very Low

Looking at the card type breakdown:
- Mono-Stone: 38 characters, 2 events (Summons of the Bonded, Surge of Fury, Break the Veil, Lurking Dread -- actually 4 events)
- Mono-Ruin: 40 characters, 5 events (Path to Redemption, Weight of Memory, Through the Rift, and the 2 existing dual-reverted ones)
- Neutral provides the bulk of events (many events)

Bedrock has very few events relative to other archetypes. This means:
- Starcatcher (Stone, "when you play event, gain 1 energy") is weak in Bedrock
- Whisper of the Past ("event in void gains Reclaim 0") has fewer targets
- The event-heavy enablers from other archetypes (Tempest's storm package) are inaccessible

This is not necessarily a problem -- Bedrock is a creature-based reanimator archetype. But it does limit deckbuilding flexibility and makes the archetype more predictable.

### Problem 4: The Mana Curve Is Top-Heavy

Bedrock's best payoffs are expensive: The Rising God (9), The Devourer (8), Path to Redemption (6), Titan of Forgotten Echoes (6), Nexus Wayfinder (5), Speaker for the Forgotten (5). While the whole point is to cheat on mana through Reclaim, the deck needs setup time AND the Reclaim enablers. Games where you draw your expensive targets without enablers (or vice versa) are very difficult.

Deepvault Keeper at 3-cost only reduces void-play costs by 1, which does not solve the fundamental issue of needing 5-6 energy turns to hard-cast targets that didn't get milled. The Roothold Keeper loop (net 1 cost from void) is value-positive but does not accelerate big plays.

### Problem 5: No Fast-Speed Interaction from Core Plan

Bedrock has zero fast events and zero fast characters in its core reanimation package. All of its key plays happen at sorcery speed. This means:
- No ability to respond to opponent threats at instant speed (must rely on neutral Break the Sequence or Stone's limited options)
- Ruin's Ashlight Caller (Fast Character) and Eternal Sentry (Fast Character) provide some fast-speed presence but are Undertow-oriented
- Aggressive decks (Gale with its fast character suite) can play around Bedrock completely by threatening lethal during their turn

### Overall Assessment: Is Bedrock Better in V2?

**Yes, substantially.** The archetype went from 23 core cards and a B- grade to a 110-card accessible pool with genuine build diversity. Specific improvements:

1. **Roothold Keeper** provides a second void-only character at a different cost point, reducing the "Revenant or bust" problem.
2. **Deepvault Keeper** provides the cost reduction Bedrock desperately needed.
3. **Risen Champion** adds a void-only Warrior that bridges to Crucible's Warrior tribal.
4. **The expanded Stone pool** provides energy ramp (Virtuoso of Harmony, Dawnblade Wanderer, Nexus Wayfinder) that funds the reanimation plan.

**But it remains one of the weaker archetypes**, likely ranking 7th-8th out of 10. The fundamental fragility issue -- needing to both fill the void AND find enablers to exploit it -- has not been fully solved. The archetype's ceiling is spectacular (Revenant + Titan + The Devourer on the same board is game-ending), but its floor is the lowest of any archetype (expensive dead cards in hand, empty void, no Reclaim enablers).

**The Stone deficit fix helps Bedrock only at the margins.** The 7 new Stone cards were correctly targeted at Crucible and Basalt, which needed them more. Bedrock's real improvements came from the Ruin-side new cards (Risen Champion, Tidechannel Observer) and the signpost dual (Roothold Keeper). The next iteration could consider 1-2 more Stone cards that specifically bridge to void play (e.g., a Stone event that mills, or a Stone character that triggers when you play from void).

**Final grade: B (up from B- in v1).** Functional, draftable, has exciting moments, but still the archetype most likely to trainwreck when key pieces are missing.
