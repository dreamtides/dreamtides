## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth -- 9/10

Basalt has one of the deepest tribal cores in the format. Counting cards that are explicitly tagged with "Basalt" as a primary archetype or are Spirit Animal tribal cards:

**Dedicated Basalt cards (Zephyr-side):** Spirit Bond, Lumineth, Eternal Stag, Spiritbound Alpha, Sunshadow Eagle, Ebonwing, Seeker of the Radiant Wilds, Mystic Runefish, Dreamborne Leviathan, Light of Emergence, Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, Mirrorlight Architect, The Bondweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer, Soulflame Predator (16 cards)

**Dedicated Basalt cards (Stone-side):** Ghostlight Wolves, Ethereal Courser, Dawnprowler Panther, Luminwings, Spirit of the Greenwood, Driftcaller Sovereign, Emerald Guardian, Angel of the Eclipse, Nexus Wayfinder, Dawnblade Wanderer, Bloomweaver, Surge of Fury, Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit, Starcatcher (16 cards)

**Signpost:** Stoneveil Guardian (1 card)

**Total on-plan cards:** 33 cards across both resonances, plus numerous generically useful cards. This is an extremely deep core; Basalt never starves for on-tribe picks.

The only deduction: the core is *so* deep on the creature side that it risks feeling like every Basalt deck builds itself -- the density of auto-includes is very high (see Problems section).

### Signpost Quality -- 7/10

Stoneveil Guardian is a well-designed signpost with a genuine mode switch:
- **Wide board (3+ allies):** Gain 2 energy -- fuels activated abilities like Spiritbound Alpha and Mystic Runefish
- **Thin board:** Allies gain +1 spark EOT -- recovery mode when behind

Strengths:
- Spirit Animal subtype for tribal density
- 3-cost fits the curve perfectly
- Both modes are genuinely useful to Basalt
- The mode switch creates board-state reading rather than player choice

Weaknesses:
- At uncommon, it shows up reliably but does not feel as splashy as some rare signposts (Stormtide Oracle, Ashfire Ritualist)
- The energy mode (the more common mode in Basalt) is "gain 2 energy" -- functional but not exciting
- Does not directly reference Spirit Animals, so the tribal signal is subtler than, say, Forgeborn Martyr naming Warriors

Score of 7: solid and functional, but lacks the "build-around me" magnetism of top-tier signposts.

### Mechanical Coherence -- 9/10

Basalt's game plan is among the most mechanically coherent in the format:

1. **Deploy cheap Spirit Animals** (1-3 cost, many at 1 energy)
2. **Judgment triggers generate energy** (Ghostlight Wolves, Luminwings, Spirit of the Greenwood, Driftcaller Sovereign, Emerald Guardian, Dawnblade Wanderer)
3. **Activated abilities convert energy into spark** (Spiritbound Alpha: pay 4 for SAs +2 spark; Mystic Runefish: pay 3 for SAs become 5 spark)
4. **Finishers scale with board width** (Spirit Bond, Conduit of Resonance, Ironveil Watcher)

The energy ramp -> activated ability -> spark conversion pipeline is tight and self-reinforcing. Every piece of the engine benefits every other piece. Materialize triggers (Sunshadow Eagle, The Bondweaver, Dawnprowler Panther, Angel of the Eclipse, Blazing Emberwing) create a secondary axis rewarding the same action (deploying creatures) that the energy axis also rewards.

The only incoherence: two new Stone cards (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden) use "been on the battlefield since your last turn" which is explicitly anti-synergy with Zephyr's flicker effects. This is documented as intentional tension, and Basalt is not a flicker deck, so these cards actually reward Basalt's "stay and fight" board-building approach. Still, a first-time drafter might grab these thinking they are on-plan and then discover the conflict with any Zephyr flicker cards they also drafted.

### Draft Signal Clarity -- 8/10

**Strong signals:**
- Spirit Animal subtype is an extremely clear tribal signal (17 of 19 total SAs live in Zephyr+Stone)
- Any Spirit Animal past pick 3 is a strong Basalt signal
- The "Judgment: Gain energy" pattern is overwhelmingly concentrated in Stone and immediately suggests the ramp plan
- Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, and Spirit Bond are loud "you are Basalt" cards

**Moderate signals:**
- Stoneveil Guardian at uncommon appears frequently enough to signal
- Nexus Wayfinder (characters cost 2 less) is shared with Depths/Bedrock but reads as Basalt to anyone holding cheap SAs

**Weak signals:**
- Many of the energy-generation Stone cards (Bloomweaver, Dawnblade Wanderer) also serve Crucible, so they are ambiguous picks in early packs
- Non-SA creatures from Stone (Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit) could be Crucible or Basalt picks

Deduction: Bloomweaver being tagged "Crucible, Basalt" and Dawnblade Wanderer being tagged similarly means some critical ramp pieces send split signals. But SA creatures are unambiguous, so the tribal half of the signal is very clean.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility -- 6/10

This is Basalt's weakest dimension. The archetype has a strong "default build" -- Spirit Animal tribal with energy ramp -- and the vast majority of successful Basalt decks will converge toward a similar 25-30 card core. The flexibility score reflects:

**Positive flexibility:**
- Choice between "go-wide aggro" (cheap SAs, Sunshadow Eagle, The Bondweaver) and "ramp-to-combo" (Conduit of Resonance, Spiritbound Alpha, Spirit Bond)
- Flicker sub-theme via Zephyr (Ethereal Courser, Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer) creates a genuine alternative axis
- Mirrorlight Architect opens a "clone" sub-build
- Access to Stone's control suite (Paradox Enforcer, Riftwalker, Cloaked Sentinel) for a slower Depths-leaning build

**Negative flexibility:**
- The archetype is fundamentally tribal -- Spirit Animal density is king, which constrains how many off-tribe cards you can include
- Almost no event-based strategy; Basalt is overwhelmingly creature-focused (only Spirit Bond and Light of Emergence are high-priority events)
- The energy ramp infrastructure is so specific that there is little room for creative energy sinks beyond Spiritbound Alpha and Mystic Runefish
- Non-SA creatures dilute Ghostlight Wolves, Dawnprowler Panther, Luminwings payoffs, creating real tension about including generically good cards

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Boundless Wanderer (Neutral, 2 cost, 2 spark, Common)

Often overlooked because it is a neutral common, Boundless Wanderer is secretly one of Basalt's best cards. It has **all character types**, which means it counts as a Spirit Animal for every tribal payoff: Ghostlight Wolves' energy per SA, Dawnprowler Panther's materialize-SA trigger, Sunshadow Eagle's +1 spark, Spiritbound Alpha's mass +2 spark, Spirit Bond's exponential scaling, and Luminwings' 2+ SA condition. At 2 cost and 2 spark (baseline-efficient), it also triggers its own Judgment ability with 3+ same-type allies (trivially satisfied in Basalt). Because it is neutral and common, it often wheels to late picks where Basalt drafters can snap it up.

### 2. Surge of Fury (Stone, 1 cost, Event, Uncommon)

A 1-energy event that triggers an additional Judgment phase sounds innocuous, but in Basalt it is devastating. Every Judgment trigger fires twice: Ghostlight Wolves generates double energy, Ebonwing kindles twice, Ironveil Watcher scores double points, Spirit of the Greenwood ramps double. With Conduit of Resonance turning materializations into Judgment triggers, Surge of Fury can create explosive turns where a single materialize triggers 8+ Judgment abilities twice. Crucible drafters may eye this card too, but it over-performs more dramatically in Basalt because of the sheer density of Judgment triggers.

### 3. Vanguard of the Summit (Stone, 4 cost, Mage, Rare -- NEW)

This card reads as Crucible-oriented, but Basalt is actually better positioned to trigger "play your third character this turn." With Nexus Wayfinder reducing character costs by 2, and a hand full of 1-cost SAs (Ebonwing, Dawnprowler Panther, Driftcaller Sovereign, Luminwings, Mystic Runefish), Basalt can easily play 3+ characters in one turn. The reward -- draw 2 and gain 2 energy -- is massive when you are chaining cheap SAs together. Crucible drafters want this but often cannot trigger it as reliably as Basalt can.

---

## 4. Two Different Builds

### Build A: "Spirit Engine" (Go-Wide Aggro Ramp)

**Strategy:** Deploy a critical mass of cheap Spirit Animals, generate cascading energy through Judgment triggers, then use Spiritbound Alpha or Mystic Runefish as a finisher to convert energy into spark.

**Key Cards (approximate 25-card shell):**

*Spirit Animals (12-14):*
Ebonwing, Driftcaller Sovereign, Luminwings, Dawnprowler Panther, Mystic Runefish, Sunshadow Eagle, Eternal Stag, Ghostlight Wolves, Emerald Guardian, Spirit of the Greenwood, Spiritbound Alpha, Blazing Emberwing, Stoneveil Guardian

*Non-SA Payoffs (4-5):*
The Bondweaver, Seeker of the Radiant Wilds, Bloomweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer, Boundless Wanderer

*Ramp Enablers (3-4):*
Dawnblade Wanderer, Surge of Fury, Arc Gate Opening, Glimpse of Infinity

*Finisher(s) (1-2):*
Spirit Bond, Light of Emergence

*Flex/Removal (2-3):*
Veil Shatter, Scorched Reckoning, Break the Sequence

**Play Pattern:** Turns 1-3: Deploy 3-5 cheap SAs. Turn 4+: Each Judgment phase generates 6-10 energy. Use Spiritbound Alpha (pay 4: all SAs +2 spark) or Mystic Runefish (pay 3: all SAs become 5 spark) for huge spark spikes. Spirit Bond as a late-game closer if the game goes long. Blazing Emberwing converts every new SA deployment into a Judgment trigger, amplifying the engine.

**Strengths:** Extremely fast engine online (turn 3), resilient to spot removal (many bodies), consistent due to high tribal density.
**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to mass dissolve (Burst of Obliteration, Apocalypse), low individual spark on most bodies, minimal interaction.

---

### Build B: "Judgment Storm" (Conduit Combo)

**Strategy:** Build toward Conduit of Resonance (5 cost), which makes every materialize trigger all Judgment abilities. Pair with Ironveil Watcher and multiple Judgment-trigger bodies to convert each materialize into a storm of points, energy, and kindle.

**Key Cards (approximate 25-card shell):**

*Engine Centerpiece (2-3):*
Conduit of Resonance, Ironveil Watcher, Blazing Emberwing

*Judgment Bodies (8-10):*
Ghostlight Wolves, Emerald Guardian, Spirit of the Greenwood, Ebonwing, Driftcaller Sovereign, Luminwings, Stoneheart Veteran, Dawnblade Wanderer, Lantern Keeper, Stoneveil Guardian

*Cheap Materialize Fuel (5-6):*
Dawnprowler Panther, Ethereal Courser, Nomad of Endless Paths, Ethereal Trailblazer, Bloomweaver, Angel of the Eclipse

*Cost Reduction / Ramp (3-4):*
Nexus Wayfinder, Surge of Fury, Vanguard of the Summit, Arc Gate Opening

*Finisher(s) (1-2):*
Mystic Runefish, Spirit Bond

*Removal / Flex (2-3):*
Abyssal Plunge, Scorched Reckoning, Kindlespark Harvester

**Play Pattern:** Turns 1-4: Deploy Judgment bodies while ramping energy. Turn 5+: Land Conduit of Resonance. Each subsequent materialize triggers ALL Judgment abilities of ALL allies simultaneously. With 4 Judgment bodies, one materialize generates 4+ energy, 1-3 points (Ironveil Watcher), kindle, Foresee, and more. Ethereal Courser bouncing an ally and re-materializing it creates a double-trigger per bounce. Surge of Fury doubles the Judgment phase for an even more explosive turn.

**Strengths:** Higher ceiling than Build A; Conduit + Ironveil Watcher can score 6-9 points in a single turn. More resilient individual bodies (Conduit at 5-cost, 2 spark is hard to dissolve cheaply).
**Weaknesses:** Slower to assemble (Conduit is 5-cost and rare), more dependent on a single card, weaker if Conduit is never drawn or is prevented/dissolved.

---

## 5. Problems

### Problem 1: Auto-Build Risk (Severity: Moderate)

Basalt has approximately 33 cards that are obviously on-plan. In a typical draft deck of ~25 cards, this means the archetype drafts itself with minimal decision-making once you are in it. The tension between "include this Spirit Animal or that Spirit Animal" is less interesting than "should I include this card that pulls me in a different direction." The tribal density is so high that the marginal decisions are mostly about ordering within-tribe cards rather than making genuine sacrifices.

**Mitigation in v2:** Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit, and Kindlespark Harvester are all non-SA cards that are genuinely excellent in Basalt, creating real "dilute tribal density for raw power" decisions. But the core tribal package is still very deep.

### Problem 2: Event Starvation (Severity: Low-Moderate)

Basalt's accessible pool is overwhelmingly creature-oriented. Among the ~33 on-plan cards, only 3 are events (Spirit Bond, Light of Emergence, Surge of Fury). This means:
- Spirit of Smoldering Echoes and Starcatcher (event-payoff cards in Stone) are nearly dead in Basalt
- The archetype has minimal interaction (no prevent, almost no dissolve)
- Opponents who focus on event-based strategies (Tempest, Depths) can play a fundamentally different game that Basalt cannot interact with

Basalt compensates through raw speed and board presence, but the lack of interaction can feel frustrating when the opponent is on a non-interactive combo plan.

### Problem 3: Mass Removal Fragility (Severity: Moderate)

Basalt's entire engine depends on board presence. A single Apocalypse (6 energy, dissolve all characters) or a well-timed Burst of Obliteration devastates the strategy. Most SA bodies have 1 spark, making them trivially wiped by Burst of Obliteration paying 2 energy. Recovery is possible (Basalt reloads fast if it still has cards in hand), but losing 4-5 SAs mid-game often means losing the Judgment-energy chain that funds the comeback.

No cards in Basalt's pool specifically protect against mass removal. Together Against the Tide (Tide, prevents events that could dissolve allies) is not accessible.

### Problem 4: Signpost Competition with Crucible (Severity: Low)

Several key Stone ramp cards (Bloomweaver, Dawnblade Wanderer, Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran) are tagged for both Crucible and Basalt. In a draft where two players are fighting over Stone, these contested picks can starve either archetype. The SA-specific cards are uncontested, but the energy infrastructure is shared.

This is partially by design (adjacent archetypes should share cards), but it means Basalt's consistency drops when a Crucible drafter is at the table.

### Problem 5: Single Dual Signpost (Severity: Low)

With v2's policy of exactly 1 dual per archetype, Basalt gets only Stoneveil Guardian as its dual-resonance card. In v1, Conduit of Resonance and Blazing Emberwing were also dual (Zephyr+Stone), providing 3 dual signals. Now they are mono-Zephyr, which means a drafter could pick them without realizing Basalt is the intended home. The tribal SA subtype on these cards partially mitigates this, but the resonance signal is one-directional (they only signal "Zephyr" not "Zephyr+Stone").

This is a systemic constraint of the v2 dual policy rather than a Basalt-specific problem, and the depth of SA tribal largely compensates.

## Summary Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 9/10 | 33+ on-plan cards; never starves for picks |
| Signpost Quality | 7/10 | Functional mode-switch; lacks splash appeal |
| Mechanical Coherence | 9/10 | Deploy -> ramp -> convert is tight and self-reinforcing |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 8/10 | SA tribal is loud and clear; some shared ramp picks are ambiguous |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 6/10 | Deep but convergent; most builds look similar |
| **Overall** | **7.8/10** | Strong, well-defined archetype with a clear identity. Main risk is auto-build convergence reducing draft replay value. |
