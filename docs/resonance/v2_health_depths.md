# V2 Archetype Health Check: Depths (Tide + Stone) -- Control

## 1. Complete Card Pool

Depths has access to: all mono-Tide (40) + all mono-Stone (40) + Depths dual signpost (1) + all Neutral (24) = **105 cards total**.

This is the smallest accessible pool of any archetype (tied with none; next lowest is Mirage/Basalt at 108). The small pool reflects both Tide and Stone sitting at exactly 40 mono cards each, the floor of the 38-45 target range.

## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth: 7/10

Depths has 29 cards explicitly tagged for the archetype -- a solid number that places it mid-pack. The core identity is clear: Prevent-based reactive control that accumulates incremental value over time. The Prevent suite is deep (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Echoing Denial, Infernal Rest, Together Against the Tide, Maelstrom Denial, Ripple Through Reality, Cragfall, Threadbreaker, Voidshield Guardian = **10 Prevent effects**), which is more than enough to form a consistent game plan. The Stone half contributes board control bodies (Paradox Enforcer, Riftwalker, Twilight Suppressor), hand disruption (Break the Veil, Lurking Dread), and finishers (The Waking Titan, Nexus Wayfinder). However, the archetype's card advantage engines are thin -- Keeper of Forgotten Light at 6 cost is the primary draw engine, and there is no mid-cost repeatable draw outside of it. This creates a dependency on Neutral draw spells and the signpost itself for card flow.

### Signpost Quality: 8/10

Watcher of the Fathoms is an excellent signpost that crystallizes the Depths play pattern into a single card. The hand-size-gated kindle (5+ cards = kindle 2) rewards the control player's natural tendency to hold reactive spells. The Prevent-trigger energy refund (Prevent = gain 2 energy) converts defensive plays into proactive investment, solving the classic control problem of "I prevented their threat but fell behind on tempo." The card creates genuine decisions: Do you hold cards for the kindle trigger or deploy threats? Do you use your Prevents now for energy or save them for bigger threats? At 4 cost with 0 spark, it demands support -- you cannot win on its body alone. The dual resonance (Tide+Stone) ensures it appears in Depths packs reliably. This is a massive upgrade from v1, which had only 1 dual signpost for the archetype.

### Mechanical Coherence: 7/10

The Depths game plan coheres well: Prevent threats, accumulate hand cards, deploy expensive value bodies, kindle over time. The two halves contribute distinctly -- Tide provides the reactive denial suite and card flow, Stone provides the durable threats and inevitability engines. The new v2 cards strengthen coherence significantly: Duskwatch Vigil converts Prevents into tempo (Prevent = next event costs 2 less), Everhold Protector creates a ticking clock behind Prevent protection, Ironbark Warden pumps persistent bodies, and Kindlespark Harvester converts accumulated spark into removal. The main coherence gap is the awkward relationship between Depths and Stone's Warrior/Spirit Animal tribal cards -- roughly 20 of Stone's 40 cards are Warrior or Spirit Animal tribal that have minimal synergy with Depths's control plan. This means the "real" Stone pool for Depths is closer to 20 usable cards, not 40.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 6/10

This is Depths's weakest area. The Prevent cards in Tide are clean signals (only Depths and Gale want them), but many Tide cards that Depths wants (draw, card advantage, bodies) are also contested by Tempest and Mirage. On the Stone side, the signal problem is more acute: the cards Depths actually wants (Cloaked Sentinel, The Waking Titan, Paradox Enforcer, Riftwalker, Nexus Wayfinder) are scattered among 20+ Warrior/Spirit Animal tribal cards that provide no signal. A drafter seeing Stone Warrior cards passed does not know whether Stone-for-Depths is open or just that Crucible is not. The new dedicated Depths-Stone cards (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden, Kindlespark Harvester) help, but they are shared with Crucible, not exclusive to Depths. The single dual signpost means only Watcher of the Fathoms itself is an unambiguous "draft Depths" signal.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 7/10

Despite the control core, Depths supports several build variants (see Section 4 below). The Prevent suite can be configured for density (heavy counter-control) or efficiency (light splash with 4-5 key Prevents). The Stone half offers legitimate choices between value bodies, hand disruption, and Warrior splashes. Neutral cards provide important flex slots: removal (Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration), draw (Knowledge Restored, Dreamscatter), and energy (Arc Gate Opening, Glimpse of Infinity) all slot naturally into Depths. The archetype is flexible enough to adapt to what is open in a draft, though it is somewhat constrained by the need for a critical mass of Prevents to activate the signpost and Duskwatch Vigil.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Virtuoso of Harmony (Stone, 2 cost, 2 spark, Musician)

"At the end of your turn, gain 2 energy."

Listed for Depths/Bedrock, this card is easy to overlook because it has no flashy ability. But for Depths it is exceptional: a 2-cost body with 2 spark that generates 2 energy every turn passively. Behind Prevent protection, it ramps you into your expensive finishers (Keeper of Forgotten Light at 6, Paradox Enforcer at 5, Riftwalker at 5, The Waking Titan at 5) while scoring 2 spark at Judgment. It is the quintessential Depths card -- unassuming, persistent, inevitable. Crucible and Basalt drafters rarely want this because it is not a Warrior or Spirit Animal, so it often wheels.

### 2. Cloaked Sentinel (Stone, 3 cost, 2 spark, Mage)

"Opponent's events cost 1 more."

Moved from Tide to Stone in v2 (correctly -- it is a proactive tax, not reactive denial), this card is a perfect Depths complement. It makes the opponent's removal and card advantage cost more, which is exactly what a Prevent-based control deck wants. The opponent must now choose between playing through the tax or holding cards, either of which benefits Depths. Combined with Prevent effects, you create a soft-lock: the opponent's events cost more AND might get countered. Crucible drafters rarely want a Mage with no Warrior synergy, so this is often available.

### 3. Dreamtide Cartographer (Tide, 3 cost, 1 spark, Explorer) [NEW]

"Judgment: 3 or fewer in hand draw 2; else allies +1 spark EOT."

Tagged for Gale/Tempest/Eclipse (not Depths!), this card is secretly excellent in Depths. Depths naturally maintains a full hand due to holding reactive spells, so this almost always fires the spark mode: all allies gain +1 spark EOT. On a board with 3-4 Depths bodies (typical mid-game), that is +3-4 spark per Judgment -- a massive clock. The card is not tagged for Depths, so other Depths drafters (rare as they are) might not even know to pick it up. Gale and Tempest drafters want the draw mode, so when they pass it, Depths is happy to take a card that reads "Judgment: all allies +1 spark."

---

## 4. Two Different Builds

### Build A: "Fortress Control" (Prevent-Heavy)

**Core philosophy:** Maximum denial. Counter everything important, deploy a few high-value finishers, grind the opponent out of resources.

**Key cards:**
- **Prevent suite (8-10 cards):** Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Echoing Denial, Infernal Rest, Together Against the Tide, Cragfall, Ripple Through Reality, Maelstrom Denial, Threadbreaker
- **Signpost engine:** Watcher of the Fathoms (kindle 2 from holding cards, energy from Prevents)
- **Prevent payoffs:** Duskwatch Vigil (Prevent = next event costs 2 less), Voidshield Guardian (auto-Prevent dissolves)
- **Finishers:** Keeper of Forgotten Light (draw 2 on materialize), Paradox Enforcer (banish enemy permanently), Riftwalker (banish enemy until next main), Cosmic Puppeteer (steal enemy)
- **Value engine:** Cloaked Sentinel (tax), Virtuoso of Harmony (ramp), Everhold Protector (ticking kindle clock)
- **Disruption:** Break the Veil, Lurking Dread (hand attack from Stone side)
- **Flex slots:** Neutral removal (Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge), Neutral draw (Knowledge Restored, Dreamscatter)

**Win condition:** Kindle accumulation from Watcher of the Fathoms and Everhold Protector, combined with 2-3 high-spark bodies (Pallid Arbiter at 2, Wraith at 2, Paradox Enforcer at 2). The Prevent wall ensures the opponent cannot develop faster than you score.

**Strengths:** Extremely resilient against aggro. Excellent against Tempest storm turns (counter the key event). Cloaked Sentinel + Prevent creates a soft-lock.

**Weaknesses:** Slow to close games. Vulnerable to hand-flood if Prevents have no targets. Weak against wide boards that deploy under the Prevent threshold.

---

### Build B: "Midrange Value" (Body-Centric)

**Core philosophy:** Deploy efficient, persistent bodies from Stone. Use a light Prevent splash to protect them. Win through board presence and incremental spark accumulation.

**Key cards:**
- **Light Prevent package (4-5 cards):** Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Cragfall, Together Against the Tide
- **Signpost:** Watcher of the Fathoms (still strong with fewer Prevents -- hand-size kindle is the primary mode)
- **Stone value bodies:** The Waking Titan (5 cost, 3 spark, draw 1/Judgment), Nexus Wayfinder (5 cost, characters cost 2 less), Twilight Suppressor (3 cost, disable enemy activated abilities), Ironbark Warden (Judgment: persistent allies +1 spark)
- **Ramp:** Virtuoso of Harmony, Emerald Guardian (3 cost SA, Judgment: gain 2 energy), Bloomweaver (1 cost, materialize character = gain 1 energy)
- **Tempo tools:** Pallid Arbiter (disable enemy Materialized), Wraith of Twisting Shadows (hand disruption), Duskwatch Vigil
- **Finisher:** Dreamtide Cartographer (spark mode pumps board), Kindlespark Harvester (convert spark to removal)
- **Draw:** Frost Visionary (Materialized: draw 1), Looming Oracle (Materialized: draw 1)

**Win condition:** Deploy 3-5 mid-cost bodies, protect them with light Prevents, and accumulate spark through Ironbark Warden, Everhold Protector, and Dreamtide Cartographer's Judgment spark pump. Nexus Wayfinder enables deploying multiple bodies per turn in the late game.

**Strengths:** More proactive than Build A. Better board presence means more Judgment scoring. Less dependent on drawing the right Prevent at the right time.

**Weaknesses:** Lighter Prevent package means more vulnerable to opponent's key threats. Requires finding the right Stone bodies, which compete with Crucible/Basalt drafters. Higher curve means energy-hungry.

## 5. Problem Analysis

### The V1 Signpost Problem

**V1 had exactly 1 dual signpost for Depths.** This was flagged as a CRITICAL failure in the v1 assessment. With only 1 dual card bridging Tide and Stone, the archetype had no reliable way to signal "I am drafting Depths specifically" and no card that rewarded being in both Tide and Stone simultaneously.

### Does Watcher of the Fathoms Fix This?

**Yes, substantially.** Watcher of the Fathoms is a well-designed signpost that:

1. **Mechanically unifies both halves.** The hand-size kindle rewards Tide's card accumulation (drawing, holding Prevents) while the Prevent-trigger energy rewards Stone's desire for ramp. A pure Tide or pure Stone drafter gets only half the card's value.

2. **Creates a unique play pattern.** No other archetype rewards the specific combination of "hold a full hand" + "counter opponent's cards" + "accumulate spark through kindle." This makes Depths feel distinct in gameplay, not just in card selection.

3. **Provides an actual draft signal.** When Watcher of the Fathoms appears in a pack, it is a clear "Depths is open" signal that cannot be misread.

**However, the fix is partial, not complete.** V2 mandates exactly 1 dual per archetype, so Depths goes from 1 dual to... 1 dual. The number has not changed. What has changed is the **quality** of that 1 dual -- from a v1 placeholder to a purpose-built signpost. The structural limitation remains: Depths has exactly 1 card that rewards being in both Tide and Stone simultaneously, while other archetypes also have exactly 1.

### Remaining Problems

**Problem 1: Stone card pool dilution.** Of Stone's 40 cards, roughly 18-20 are Warrior or Spirit Animal tribal cards that have little to no synergy with Depths's control plan. This means the effective Stone pool for Depths is closer to 20-22 cards, not 40. Crucible (Warrior tribal) and Basalt (Spirit Animal tribal) consume the majority of Stone's identity. Depths gets the "leftovers" -- the non-tribal control cards. While these leftovers are individually strong (The Waking Titan, Riftwalker, Paradox Enforcer, Cloaked Sentinel), the volume is thin.

**Problem 2: No event-based removal in mono-Tide or mono-Stone.** Depths's removal options are almost entirely creature-based (Paradox Enforcer banishes, Riftwalker banishes, Twilight Suppressor disables). The only event-based removal from the core resonances is the hand disruption suite (Break the Veil, Lurking Dread). All dissolve effects come from Neutral (Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration) or Ember (which Depths cannot access). This makes Depths dependent on Neutral removal, which every archetype also wants.

**Problem 3: Win condition speed.** Depths's primary win condition is kindle accumulation (Watcher of the Fathoms, Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden) which is inherently slow. Against fast archetypes like Gale or Cinder that can score 15+ points by turn 4-5, Depths needs time it may not have. The archetype lacks a "close the game now" finisher comparable to Spirit Bond (Basalt), Illumination of Glory (Tempest), or Fathomless Maw (Cinder).

**Problem 4: Overlapping Depths cards with Crucible.** Several of the new Stone cards tagged for Depths are also tagged for Crucible: Everhold Protector (Depths, Crucible), Kindlespark Harvester (Crucible, Cinder, Depths), Ironbark Warden (Crucible, Depths), Twilight Suppressor (Crucible, Depths). In a draft where both Depths and Crucible are being contested, these cards will be snapped up by Crucible (where they are stronger due to Warrior density). Depths may struggle to get its Stone half when Crucible is open.

**Problem 5: Low total accessible pool.** At 105 cards, Depths has the smallest accessible pool of any archetype. While 105 is well above the 60-80 minimum target, the effective pool (after removing Warrior/Spirit Animal tribal cards that do not serve Depths) is more like 75-80 cards. This is still adequate but leaves less margin for draft variance.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

Depths in v2 is a **functional, coherent archetype** with a clearly defined control identity. The v1 signpost problem has been addressed through Watcher of the Fathoms, which is one of the better-designed signposts in the set. The new cards (Duskwatch Vigil, Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden, Kindlespark Harvester) add meaningful new axes that the archetype was missing -- Prevent payoffs, persistence rewards, and spark-as-resource conversion.

The archetype's main vulnerability is structural: Stone's card pool is dominated by tribal cards for other archetypes, leaving Depths with a thin effective pool from its second color. This is partially mitigated by the fact that the non-tribal Stone cards that Depths does get are individually powerful -- but it means Depths drafters need to be more opportunistic and flexible than, say, Crucible drafters who have a deep well of dedicated tribal support.

**Grade: B+.** A solid archetype with a clear identity and good signpost, held back by pool dilution and draft signal challenges. The v2 changes represent a meaningful improvement over v1.
