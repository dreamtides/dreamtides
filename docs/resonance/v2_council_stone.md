# Stone Advocate Position Paper -- V2 Design Council

**Advocate for:** Depths (Tide+Stone), Basalt (Zephyr+Stone), Crucible (Stone+Ember), Bedrock (Stone+Ruin)

---

## 1. Stone's Deficit Fix: 31 to 40 -- Assessment

The headline: **Stone at 40 mono is a complete numerical success.** The 9-card jump resolves the most acute structural problem from v1. Every Stone archetype now has a viable accessible pool (105-110 cards). The execution is clean:

- 7 new mono-Stone cards, all well-designed
- Cloaked Sentinel returned to Stone (mechanically correct)
- Starcatcher moved to Stone (debatable -- see Section 4)
- Surge of Fury reverted from dual to mono-Stone
- Pallid Arbiter correctly moved out to Tide

**However, "40 Stone cards" is misleading for two of my four archetypes.** The Stone pool is dominated by two tribal packages -- Warriors (12 cards) and Spirit Animals (7 cards) -- that consume nearly half the pool. These cards are excellent for Crucible and Basalt respectively, but they are dead weight for Depths and Bedrock:

| Archetype | Effective Stone Pool | Of 40 |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Crucible | 30-35 | Excellent |
| Basalt | 25-30 | Good |
| Depths | 18-22 | Thin |
| Bedrock | 10-15 | Critical |

**Bedrock gets the least from the Stone deficit fix.** Of the 7 new Stone cards, only Deepvault Keeper is a direct Bedrock enabler. The Stone count went from 31 to 40, but Bedrock's effective Stone contribution barely moved. This is the single biggest concern in my portfolio.

## 2. Bedrock's Continued Fragility -- The Biggest Problem

Bedrock at 6.8/10 is the weakest archetype in the format. The health check is blunt: "still the archetype most likely to trainwreck when key pieces are missing." Let me be specific about what is wrong and what can be fixed.

### What V2 Got Right
- Roothold Keeper is a clean, well-designed signpost
- Deepvault Keeper + Roothold Keeper create a real economic engine
- Risen Champion adds Warrior recursion depth
- Three void-only characters (up from 1) gives the archetype structural redundancy

### What Remains Broken

**Problem A: Stone-Ruin Mechanical Incoherence (6/10).** Stone's identity is permanence, board presence, and Judgment-phase scoring. Ruin's identity is void interaction, recursion, and transience. These are fundamentally different -- almost opposite -- orientations. The mechanical overlap zone is paper-thin: only Deepvault Keeper, Speaker for the Forgotten, and Nexus Wayfinder genuinely bridge both identities. Compare this to Crucible (Stone+Ember), where the Warrior tribe provides a continuous thread across both resonances.

**Problem B: No Stone Card That Cares About Void Play.** This is the specific, fixable gap. Deepvault Keeper is alone. Every other Stone card either cares about Judgment triggers, board presence, tribal density, or energy ramp -- none of which intersect with "playing characters from the void." A single additional Stone card with a void-play trigger would dramatically improve coherence.

**Problem C: Top-Heavy Curve with Fragile Assembly.** Bedrock's payoffs (Revenant 3-cost/6-spark, Titan 6-cost/4-spark, The Devourer 8-cost/8-spark, The Rising God 9-cost/6-spark) are spectacular -- if you assemble the engine. But the archetype requires BOTH filling the void AND finding enablers, creating a two-piece combo dependency that no other archetype faces. When the engine fails to assemble (wrong half of the deck drawn, key enablers taken by Undertow), Bedrock has the lowest floor in the format.

**Problem D: Ruin Competition.** Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, and Reclaimer of Lost Paths are the three cards that make Bedrock's engine work. They are also excellent in Undertow, Eclipse, and Cinder. Bedrock is the most vulnerable to being drafted out because its core enablers are shared with 3 other archetypes, and Bedrock has the weakest second color (Stone for void play is worse than Tide for Undertow, Zephyr for Eclipse, or Ember for Cinder).

### Specific Proposals for Bedrock

1. **Create a second Stone-Bedrock bridge card.** Suggestion: A Stone character (2-3 cost, 1-2 spark) with "When you materialize a character from your void, gain 2 energy" or "When a card enters your void, gain 1 energy (once per turn)." This gives Bedrock a Stone card that actually participates in the void-play plan.

2. **Consider giving Bedrock's signpost (Roothold Keeper) some spark.** At 0 spark, it is pure engine and contributes nothing to scoring. Even 1 spark would make it less fragile to include. Roothold Keeper already costs 2 and requires void-only setup -- 1 spark is fair.

3. **If any Ruin cards can be shifted to Stone without damage, do so.** Specifically, could Ashen Avenger (Ruin Warrior, self-reclaims) become Stone? It is a Warrior that recurses from the void, which is exactly the Stone-Ruin bridge identity. Its current Ruin assignment makes mechanical sense (Reclaim is Ruin's keyword), but the Warrior typing and self-reclaim pattern could also be read as "Stone permanence via recursion."

## 3. Crucible's Improved Rails Score -- Verdict: Success

The v1 problem was clear: Crucible at 9/10 on-rails was the most formulaic archetype in the format. The v2 solution -- non-Warrior power pieces that create purity-vs-power tension -- is **the best-executed fix in the entire v2 revision.**

The five non-Warrior cards (Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden, Everhold Protector) each create a genuine "include this or another Warrior for Blade of Unity" decision. The health check documents this precisely:

| Non-Warrior | Blade of Unity Cost | Compensating Power |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Ironveil Watcher | -1 spark | Up to 3 direct points per Judgment |
| Vanguard of the Summit | -1 spark | Draw 2 + gain 2 energy on 3rd character |
| Kindlespark Harvester | -1 spark | Repeatable removal (unique in Stone) |
| Ironbark Warden | -1 spark | Board-wide +1 spark (all allies, not just Warriors) |
| Everhold Protector | -1 spark | Passive kindle accumulation |

The rails score dropped from 9/10 to 6/10 -- acceptable for a tribal archetype. Both builds (Warrior Phalanx vs. Crucible Engine) are viable. Forgeborn Martyr's redesigned death trigger ("if 3+ allies" instead of "by opponent") was the correct fix.

**One concern:** The sacrifice sub-build (via Ember's Dreadcall Warden, Forsworn Champion, etc.) creates tension with the anchor mechanics (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden). This is intentional and healthy -- but it means a Crucible drafter who tries to blend both strategies will have a worse deck than one who commits. The signals for which version to draft are not as clear as they could be.

## 4. The Starcatcher Contradiction

This is the thorniest issue in my portfolio. The allocation lists Starcatcher with "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" but assigns it to Stone. Since Tempest is Tide+Ember, Tempest cannot access Stone cards. This is a documented error.

### My Position

**Starcatcher should stay in Stone.** Here is my reasoning:

1. **Starcatcher's mechanic is Stone-coded.** "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" is a persistent, incremental, ramp effect. Stone's identity is permanence and gradual accumulation. Ember's identity is burst energy (Flash of Power, Genesis Burst, Catalyst Ignition) and sacrifice. Persistent event-ramp is categorically Stone.

2. **Stone needs the count.** Moving Starcatcher back to Ember undoes part of the deficit fix, dropping Stone from 40 to 39 (still in range, but thin). Meanwhile Ember is already at the 45-card ceiling.

3. **Tempest is healthy without Starcatcher.** Tempest scores 8.2/10 (A-) with the loss already baked in. Its core depth is 9/10. Losing one energy-loop enabler does not critically damage an archetype that has Flash of Power (gain 6), Genesis Burst (double energy), Catalyst Ignition (double energy gains), and Data Pulse (gain 2 + draw 1).

4. **Starcatcher genuinely serves Basalt.** In Basalt, Starcatcher is the only Stone card that rewards event play. With Spirit Bond (12-cost event) and Light of Emergence (5-cost event) as Basalt's premier events, Starcatcher's energy refund is real. This is not a stretch tag -- it is a legitimate use case.

**What should change:** Remove "Tempest" from Starcatcher's primary archetype tag. Acknowledge the loss transparently. Do NOT move the card back to Ember -- the mechanical fit is better in Stone, the count needs it, and Tempest is healthy enough to absorb the loss.

## 5. Archetype-by-Archetype Summary

### Depths: B- (7.0/10) -- Functional but Draft-Challenged

**Strengths:** Watcher of the Fathoms is excellent (8/10 signpost). 10-card Prevent suite is deep. New Prevent payoffs (Duskwatch Vigil) and anchor effects (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden) add new axes.

**Weaknesses:** Draft signal clarity is the worst in the format (6/10). Only 18-22 of Stone's 40 cards serve Depths. The smallest accessible pool (105). Slow win condition with no "close the game" finisher.

**Request to other advocates:** I need to discuss Dreamtide Cartographer with the Tide advocate. This card is listed for Gale/Tempest/Eclipse, but its spark mode (allies +1 spark EOT with 4+ cards in hand) is secretly one of Depths's best finisher-accelerators. The Depths health check identifies it as a hidden gem. Can we add Depths to its archetype tag without changing its resonance?

### Basalt: B+ (7.8/10) -- Strong Core, Auto-Build Risk

**Strengths:** 33+ on-plan cards, the deepest tribal core in the format. 9/10 mechanical coherence. Spirit Animal signals are loud and clear.

**Weaknesses:** 6/10 deckbuilding flexibility -- most Basalt decks build themselves. Mass removal fragility (1-spark SAs die to cheap board wipes). No interaction (no Prevent, almost no dissolve from core cards).

**Status:** Basalt is in a good place. The auto-build issue is inherent to tribal archetypes and cannot be fully solved without damaging the tribal identity. The new non-SA Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit) provide some "dilute tribal for power" decisions. No major changes needed.

### Crucible: B+ (7.6/10) -- Mission Accomplished on Rails

**Strengths:** Forgeborn Martyr is top-3 signpost quality. Purity-vs-power tension is well-calibrated. Rails improved from 9/10 to 6/10.

**Weaknesses:** Still the most linear archetype. Warrior recursion requires Ruin (inaccessible). No fast-speed interaction from Stone. Event poverty in Stone.

**Status:** Crucible is working as designed. The archetype is linear by nature (Warrior tribal), and the v2 non-Warrior power pieces successfully create draft tension. The sacrifice sub-build via Ember adds a second axis. No major changes needed.

### Bedrock: C+ (6.8/10) -- Improved but Still the Weakest

See Section 2 above. This is my priority concern. The archetype needs 1-2 more Stone cards that bridge to void play, and the signpost could use spark to reduce fragility.

## 6. Specific Proposals (Summary)

| # | Proposal | Affects | Severity |
|---|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Add 1 Stone card with void-play trigger for Bedrock | Stone +1, needs offset | HIGH |
| 2 | Remove "Tempest" from Starcatcher's archetype tag | Tag cleanup only | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Add "Depths" to Dreamtide Cartographer's archetype tag | Tag update only | LOW |
| 4 | Consider Roothold Keeper at 1 spark (up from 0) | Balance tweak | LOW |
| 5 | Evaluate Ashen Avenger for Stone reassignment | Ruin -1, Stone +1 | EXPLORATORY |

---

## 7. Cards I Am Willing to Trade or Concede

To address issues in other advocates' portfolios, I am willing to negotiate:

- **Starcatcher stays in Stone** is my firm position, but I will listen to Ember/Tide arguments.
- **I acknowledge Basalt's auto-build problem** and will not block solutions that slightly reduce Basalt's tribal density if they improve format health.
- **I will consider reassigning 1-2 borderline Stone cards** (e.g., Spirit of the Greenwood, Emerald Guardian) if another resonance's deficit is more acute than the loss to Stone. But Stone is at 40 (the floor of the range) -- any losses must be offset.
- **I do NOT oppose the Dreamtide Cartographer move to Zephyr** (from Tide) that the integration review recommends. This helps Gale and Basalt while costing Depths only a supplementary card. However, I want Depths added to the archetype tag if it stays Tide.
