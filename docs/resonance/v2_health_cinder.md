## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth: 9/10

Cinder has the deepest, most self-consistent sacrifice engine in the format. The mono-Ember half contains **18+ cards** with explicit abandon mechanics (Obliterator of Worlds, Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, Spirit Reaping, Desperation, Pulse of Sacrifice, Harvester of Despair, Blade of Oblivion, Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker, Infernal Ascendant, Shardwoven Tyrant, Grim Reclaimer, Specter of Silent Snow, Soulbinder, Exiles of the Last Light, Ashen Remnant, Rebirth Ritualist). The mono-Ruin half provides the recursion loop (void-to-hand/battlefield cards) and "dissolved" payoffs (Silent Avenger, Seer of the Fallen, Dustborn Veteran, Sunset Chronicler, Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning, Volcanic Channeler) that close the sacrifice-recur cycle. Ashfire Ritualist ties both halves together. This is an embarrassment of riches.

The only reason it is not 10/10 is that a few of these payoffs are nearly identical in function (Forsworn Champion vs. Harvester of Despair both give +1 spark on abandon; Exiles of the Last Light and Infernal Ascendant both kindle on abandon), creating some internal redundancy at the payoff tier.

### Signpost Quality: 9/10

Ashfire Ritualist is an excellent signpost. It does three things simultaneously: (a) kindle 1 on any void entry, rewarding the natural Cinder game flow; (b) abandon ally to return a different character from void to hand, creating the sacrifice-recursion engine loop; (c) the once-per-turn caps on both abilities prevent degeneracy while still being powerful enough to build around. The card clearly communicates "sacrifice your allies, get them back, and accumulate kindle while doing it." A drafter who picks this up immediately understands the archetype's game plan.

One minor note: it is a Rare, which means it will be seen less frequently in draft pools. However, Cinder's sacrifice theme is so densely represented in its mono-Ember cards that the archetype is recognizable even without the signpost.

### Mechanical Coherence: 8/10

The archetype's two halves mesh well. Ember provides the sacrifice outlets and payoffs (points, spark, energy, draw, removal). Ruin provides the recursion pipeline (Reclaim, void-to-hand, void-to-play) and dissolved triggers. The game loop is: materialize cheap bodies, sacrifice for value, recur from void, repeat.

The deduction comes from a tension in the Ruin half. Ruin is heavily weighted toward Survivor tribal and Undertow-flavored cards (mill-centric, void-volume scaling). A significant portion of Ruin's 45 cards are optimized for Undertow's self-mill plan rather than Cinder's sacrifice plan. Cards like Searcher in the Mists, Flagbearer of Decay, Hope's Vanguard, Soulkindler, and Veil of the Wastes are deeply invested in Survivor tribal density and mill mechanics that Cinder does not naturally leverage. Cinder wants to sacrifice and recur, not self-mill. This means roughly 10-12 of the 45 Ruin cards are suboptimal in a focused Cinder build, though still technically playable.

Additionally, the Eclipse-leaning discard-payoff cards in Ruin (Pattern Seeker, Ashmaze Guide, Apocalypse Vigilante, Forgotten Titan, Mother of Flames, Torchbearer of the Abyss, Duneveil Vanguard) form a secondary package that Cinder can partially leverage (Rebirth Ritualist and Pulse of Sacrifice discard hands), but this is not the primary plan.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 9/10

Cinder has the clearest draft signal of any archetype in the format. The word "abandon" appears on 18+ cards in the Ember column alone. When a drafter sees Forsworn Champion, Desperation, or Spirit Reaping late, the message is unambiguous: the sacrifice archetype is open. The dissolved-payoff cards in Ruin (Sunset Chronicler, Silent Avenger, Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning) are also strong directional signals.

The only mild ambiguity arises because some abandon cards (The Dread Sovereign, Grim Reclaimer) also point toward Crucible's Warrior tribal, creating a brief "am I Cinder or Crucible?" question. But this is a healthy draft tension, not a clarity problem.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 7/10

Despite the massive 115-card pool, Cinder is somewhat funneled. The core sacrifice loop is the clear plan A, and deviating from it weakens the deck significantly. However, within that constraint there is meaningful flexibility:

- **Sacrifice outlet variety:** You can choose between point-generating outlets (Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker), spark-building outlets (Forsworn Champion, Harvester of Despair, Infernal Ascendant), removal outlets (Blade of Oblivion, Shardwoven Tyrant, Obliterator of Worlds), and resource outlets (Spirit Reaping, Soulbinder, Dreadcall Warden).
- **Recursion approach variety:** Pure void recursion (Ashfire Ritualist, Shadowpaw, Starsea Traveler), dissolved-trigger chaining (Dustborn Veteran, Twilight Reclaimer), or top-of-deck manipulation (Ashen Remnant).
- **Finisher variety:** Kindle-focused, point-focused, or big-body focused (The Rising God, Titan of Forgotten Echoes).

The deduction comes from the fact that all viable Cinder builds are "sacrifice decks." There is no meaningful Cinder-aggro or Cinder-control alternative. The Tempest-leaning event-copy cards in Ember (Echo Architect, Cascade of Reflections, The Ringleader, Illumination of Glory) are largely irrelevant to Cinder.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Nightmare Manifest (Ruin, 1 energy, 1 spark, Ancient)

**Why it is overlooked:** At first glance, a symmetrical "each player abandons a character" on Judgment looks like a downside. Most drafters avoid symmetric effects.

**Why it is a gem in Cinder:** This card is asymmetric in context. Cinder WANTS to abandon its own characters (triggering Harvester of Despair, Infernal Ascendant, Fathomless Maw, etc.), while the opponent generally does not. For 1 energy, you get a body that (a) triggers all your abandon payoffs every Judgment, (b) forces the opponent to sacrifice their best character every turn, and (c) at 1 cost, it is trivially replayable. With Ashfire Ritualist on board, each Judgment triggers: abandon (payoffs fire), opponent's character enters their void or your character enters yours (kindle from Ashfire). This card is a repeatable engine piece that looks like a drawback.

### 2. Tidechannel Observer (Ruin [NEW], 3 energy, 1 spark, Ancient)

**Why it is overlooked:** The "3+ void entries this turn" threshold sounds difficult and more suited to Undertow's mill plan.

**Why it is a gem in Cinder:** In Cinder, every sacrifice sends a card to the void. A single Desperation abandoning 3 allies hits the threshold. Even modest turns -- abandon 1 ally + play 1 event that resolves to void + the abandoned ally going to void -- can hit 3. The payoff is enormous: 2 points AND kindle 1, repeating every Judgment where you sacrifice actively. This is free scoring that rewards what Cinder already does. It also does not compete for Survivor slots, giving it an entirely different deckbuilding cost than the Undertow Survivor package.

### 3. Voidthorn Protector (Ruin [NEW], 2 energy, 1 spark, Survivor)

**Why it is overlooked:** A Prevent card in Ruin seems off-archetype for Cinder.

**Why it is a gem in Cinder:** Cinder's biggest vulnerability is having key sacrifice engines dissolved by the opponent. Herald of the Last Light already demonstrates that self-sacrificing Prevent is on-plan. Voidthorn Protector gives a body (1 spark matters for kindle targets) and then converts itself into a character-targeted Prevent when your engine is threatened -- something Cinder otherwise cannot do without splashing Tide. The bonus mill-2 on Prevent fills the void for Ashfire Ritualist kindle triggers. This is defensive technology that costs nothing in deckbuilding terms because it also functions as sacrifice fodder.

---

## 4. Two Different Builds

### Build A: "The Sacrifice Engine" (Primary Cinder Build)

**Strategy:** Maximize the abandon-recur loop. Sacrifice cheap bodies repeatedly for compounding value, using kindle and direct point generation as win conditions.

**Key cards (20-card core):**
- **Engine pieces:** Ashfire Ritualist, Infernal Ascendant, Fathomless Maw, The Forsaker, Harvester of Despair
- **Sacrifice outlets:** Desperation, Spirit Reaping, Dreadcall Warden, Blade of Oblivion, Pyrokinetic Surge
- **Sacrifice fodder + recursion:** Ashen Remnant, Resilient Wanderer, Shadowpaw, Nightmare Manifest, Exiles of the Last Light, Aspiring Guardian (Neutral 0-cost body)
- **Removal:** Unleashed Destruction, Momentum of the Fallen, Shatter the Frail
- **Draw:** Prophet of the Consumed, Specter of Silent Snow

**Play pattern:** Deploy cheap bodies (Exiles, Ashen Remnant, Resilient Wanderer). Sacrifice them to Infernal Ascendant (kindle 2) or Fathomless Maw (1 point). Use Ashfire Ritualist to get a different body back. Nightmare Manifest forces the opponent to sacrifice alongside you every Judgment. Prophet of the Consumed refuels after big sacrifice turns. The kindle total climbs steadily while also generating points and removal.

**Win condition:** Kindle accumulation on leftmost character produces 5-8+ spark by midgame. Fathomless Maw and The Forsaker generate 1 point per sacrifice. Games close through spark superiority and attrition.

---

### Build B: "The Dissolved Aristocrats" (Cinder-Ruin Death Triggers)

**Strategy:** Focus on dissolved triggers rather than pure abandon. Sacrifice your own characters via abandon and also intentionally let them be dissolved by the opponent, gaining massive value from death triggers. More of a midrange attrition plan.

**Key cards (20-card core):**
- **Death trigger payoffs:** Sunset Chronicler, Silent Avenger, Seer of the Fallen, Dustborn Veteran, Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning, Volcanic Channeler, Tidechannel Observer
- **Self-dissolution:** Obliterator of Worlds (abandon self after ETB), Apocalypse (dissolve all -- your death triggers fire on your own characters)
- **Recursion:** Ashfire Ritualist, Risen Champion, Dustborn Veteran (Reclaim on ally dissolved), Starsea Traveler
- **Sacrifice + value:** Forsworn Champion, Desperation, Ashen Threshold
- **Finisher:** The Rising God (abandon 2 to Reclaim -- massive body that keeps coming back)
- **Removal:** Momentum of the Fallen (costs 1 after a dissolve), Weight of Memory

**Play pattern:** Build a board of characters with dissolved triggers (Silent Avenger, Seer of the Fallen, Sunset Chronicler). The opponent faces a dilemma: kill them and trigger massive value (kindle 2 + draw 1 + Reclaim 1 per dissolve), or let them sit and accumulate spark. Apocalypse becomes a one-sided board wipe when your side generates 3-4 triggers per death while the opponent gets nothing. Tidechannel Observer passively scores 2 points per turn you are actively cycling characters through the void. Volcanic Channeler refunds energy to keep deploying.

**Win condition:** Attrition. The opponent cannot profitably interact with your board. Each removal spell they spend triggers 2-3 replacement effects. Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning converts every death into points. The Rising God provides a recurring 6-spark body that is nearly impossible to permanently remove.

---

## 5. Flagged Problems

### Problem 1: Fodder Scarcity -- Low Supply of Cheap, Expendable Bodies

Cinder's sacrifice engines are hungry for cheap bodies to feed them. The archetype has abundant sacrifice outlets (18+ abandon cards) but a surprisingly thin supply of bodies designed to be sacrificed and recurred cheaply.

**The expendable body pool:**
- 0-cost: Aspiring Guardian (Neutral, no ability)
- 1-cost: Nightmare Manifest, Emberwatch Veteran, Exiles of the Last Light, Twilight Reclaimer, Herald of the Last Light
- 2-cost: Ashen Remnant, Resilient Wanderer, Seer of the Fallen, Eclipse Herald, Dreadcall Warden, Soulkindler, Flagbearer of Decay

Several of these are not actually expendable -- they are engine pieces you want to keep alive (Dreadcall Warden, Seer of the Fallen). The truly "sacrifice me repeatedly" cards are a narrow list: Ashen Remnant, Resilient Wanderer, Exiles of the Last Light, and Nightmare Manifest. Radiant Trio (Neutral, 3 energy, materialize 3 figments) and Endless Projection (Neutral, 4 energy, materialize figment per character played) generate 0-spark figment tokens that are ideal sacrifice fodder, but they are expensive for what amounts to setting up future sacrifices.

**Recommendation:** The format would benefit from 1-2 more cheap Ember or Ruin characters (1-2 cost) that are explicitly designed as sacrifice fodder -- e.g., characters with "Materialized: [small effect]" and no other text, making them natural targets for the abandon-recur loop. The figment-generation strategy (Radiant Trio, Endless Projection, Packcaller of Shadows) partially addresses this but requires 3-4 energy investment before the sacrifice engine even begins.

### Problem 2: Ruin's Survivor Tribal Density Creates a Draft Tension That Can Mislead

Of Ruin's 45 mono cards, **19 are Survivors** (42% of the mono-Ruin pool). When a Cinder drafter picks up Ruin cards, they will inevitably collect Survivors. Many of these Survivors are optimized for Undertow (self-mill, Survivor-tribal-matters) rather than Cinder (sacrifice). Cards like Hope's Vanguard ("with 2+ Survivors: draw 1"), Soulkindler ("if in void, Survivors +2 spark"), and Veil of the Wastes ("materialize Survivor: Reclaim this") require Survivor density that conflicts with Cinder's desire for diverse sacrifice outlets and payoffs.

This creates a real trap: a drafter might accumulate enough Survivors from the Ruin column to activate these synergies, but the resulting deck is an awkward Undertow-Cinder hybrid that does neither plan well. The Survivor tribal cards want you to keep Survivors alive for density; Cinder wants to sacrifice them.

**Mitigating factor:** Silent Avenger, Seer of the Fallen, Dustborn Veteran, and Sunset Chronicler are Survivors with dissolved triggers that align perfectly with Cinder. The trap is specifically the mill-and-density Survivors, not the death-trigger Survivors. Experienced drafters will learn this distinction, but it is a genuine learning curve.

### Problem 3: Cinder Lacks Access to Efficient Card Draw Without Sacrifice Costs

Cinder's draw options are almost entirely sacrifice-gated: Desperation (abandon to draw), Dreadcall Warden (pay 2 + abandon to draw 2), Specter of Silent Snow (abandon to draw 1), Rebirth Ritualist (abandon + discard hand to draw 3). This is thematically appropriate but creates a practical problem: when the board is empty or nearly empty, Cinder has almost no way to rebuild.

Outside of sacrifice-gated draw, Cinder's options are: Data Pulse (2 energy, draw 1), generic Neutrals (Knowledge Restored at 5 energy, A New Adventure at 3), and Moonlit Voyage (2 energy, draw 2 discard 2). None of these are particularly efficient.

If Cinder stumbles -- a well-timed Apocalypse from the opponent, or an aggressive start that empties both hand and board -- the recovery path is painful. The archetype's draw engine requires having bodies on board to sacrifice, creating a "rich get richer, poor get poorer" dynamic that can lead to non-games when Cinder falls behind.

**Mitigating factor:** Ashfire Ritualist's void-retrieval ability helps rebuild if there are characters in the void. Shadowpaw (3 energy, Materialized: return void character to hand) also helps. But these require having energy and at least one character in play, which may not be available after a blowout.

### Problem 4: Limited Prevent/Interaction Against Opponent's Key Plays

Cinder's interactive toolkit is almost entirely dissolution-based (14 removal cards across Ember). It has very limited access to Prevent effects: Herald of the Last Light (abandon self to Prevent event), Voidthorn Protector (abandon self to Prevent character), and that is it -- both are one-shot self-sacrificing Prevents. Cinder cannot protect its key engines from the opponent's removal without spending bodies.

Compare to Depths (10+ Prevent effects), Gale (fast characters plus Prevent events), or even Tempest (with Tide's Prevent suite). Cinder relies entirely on the philosophy of "my threats are recursive, so removal is less effective against me," but this fails against banish effects (which remove from the game entirely) and against opponents who can repeatedly answer threats faster than Cinder can rebuild them.

This is a deliberate design tension and not necessarily a problem to fix, but it is worth flagging: Cinder is the archetype most vulnerable to banish-based removal (Judgment of the Blade, Veil Shatter, Riftwalker, Paradox Enforcer, Soulflame Predator banning the void).

| **Overall** | **8.4/10** | Cinder is one of the format's strongest, most distinctive archetypes |

Cinder's identity as the aristocrats/sacrifice archetype is extremely well-served by the v2 allocation. The Ashfire Ritualist signpost elegantly bridges both halves, the abandon keyword is unambiguously directional in draft, and the depth of sacrifice outlets and recursion tools supports multiple distinct builds. The primary concerns are the fodder supply, the Survivor-tribal noise from the Ruin column, and the vulnerability to board-empty states. None of these are critical issues -- they represent healthy constraints on what would otherwise be an overwhelmingly dominant archetype.
