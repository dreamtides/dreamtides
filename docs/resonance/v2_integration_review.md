# V2 Integration Review: Aggregate Analysis

---

## 1. Aggregate Statistics

### Per-Resonance Mono Counts

| Resonance | V2 Mono Count | Target Range | Status |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Tide | 40 | 38-45 | PASS |
| Zephyr | 43 | 38-45 | PASS |
| Stone | 40 | 38-45 | PASS (up from 31 in v1) |
| Ember | 45 | 38-45 | PASS (at ceiling) |
| Ruin | 45 | 38-45 | PASS (at ceiling) |

**Neutral:** 24 (target 15-25, PASS)
**Dual:** 10 (exactly 10, one per archetype, PASS)
**Grand Total:** 247 cards (222 existing + 25 new)

### Archetype Accessible Pool Sizes

| Archetype | Pool Size | Rank |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Cinder (Ember+Ruin) | 115 | Largest |
| Gale (Zephyr+Ember) | 113 | Tied 2nd |
| Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) | 113 | Tied 2nd |
| Tempest (Tide+Ember) | 110 | Tied 4th |
| Undertow (Tide+Ruin) | 110 | Tied 4th |
| Crucible (Stone+Ember) | 110 | Tied 4th |
| Bedrock (Stone+Ruin) | 110 | Tied 4th |
| Mirage (Tide+Zephyr) | 108 | Tied 8th |
| Basalt (Zephyr+Stone) | 108 | Tied 8th |
| Depths (Tide+Stone) | 105 | Smallest |

All pools fall within the 105-115 range. Spread is only 10 cards. This is a significant improvement in balance.

### Signpost Coverage

Every archetype has exactly 1 dual-resonance signpost card. This is the v2 policy (down from variable 1-4 in v1). All 10 confirmed:

| Archetype | Signpost | Rarity |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Mirage | Tideweaver Adept | Uncommon |
| Undertow | Abyssal Reclaimer | Uncommon |
| Basalt | Stoneveil Guardian | Uncommon |
| Crucible | Forgeborn Martyr | Rare |
| Cinder | Ashfire Ritualist | Rare |
| Tempest | Stormtide Oracle | Rare |
| Depths | Watcher of the Fathoms | Rare |
| Gale | Windstride Runner | Uncommon |
| Eclipse | Voidthread Weaver | Rare |
| Bedrock | Roothold Keeper | Uncommon |

### Tribal Density

**Warriors (24 total)**

| Resonance | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Stone | 12 (11 existing + 1 new Stoneheart Veteran) |
| Ember | 5 (Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, Blade of Oblivion, Eclipse Herald, Rebirth Ritualist) |
| Tide | 3 (Frost Visionary, Tranquil Duelist, Pallid Arbiter) |
| Ruin | 2 (Ashen Avenger, Risen Champion) |
| Neutral | 1 (Aspiring Guardian) |
| Dual | 1 (Forgeborn Martyr, Stone+Ember) |
| **Home pair (Stone+Ember+duals)** | **18/24 = 75%** | PASS |

**Spirit Animals (19 total)**

| Resonance | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Zephyr | 9 |
| Stone | 7 |
| Ruin | 1 (Shadowpaw) |
| Tide | 1 (Looming Oracle) |
| Dual | 1 (Stoneveil Guardian, Zephyr+Stone) |
| **Home pair (Zephyr+Stone+duals)** | **17/19 = 89%** | PASS |

**Survivors (26 total)**

| Resonance | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Ruin | 20 (19 existing + 1 new Voidthorn Protector) |
| Ember | 2 (Exiles of the Last Light, Ashen Remnant) |
| Zephyr | 1 (Wasteland Arbitrator) |
| Neutral | 1 (Ruin Scavenger) |
| Dual | 2 (Abyssal Reclaimer, Roothold Keeper) |
| **Home pair (Ruin+Tide+touching duals)** | **21/26 = 81%** | PASS |

All three tribes comfortably exceed the 65% home-pair guardrail.

### Multi-Archetype Card Percentage (New Cards)

For each of the 25 new cards, how many archetypes genuinely want it:

| Card | Archetypes That Want It | Count |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| Tideweaver Adept | Mirage, Basalt, Depths | 3 |
| Abyssal Reclaimer | Undertow, Eclipse, Mirage | 3 |
| Stoneveil Guardian | Basalt, Crucible, Mirage | 3 |
| Forgeborn Martyr | Crucible, Cinder, Bedrock | 3 |
| Ashfire Ritualist | Cinder, Undertow, Eclipse | 3 |
| Stormtide Oracle | Tempest, Depths, Undertow | 3 |
| Watcher of the Fathoms | Depths, Tempest, Basalt | 3 |
| Windstride Runner | Gale, Cinder, Eclipse | 3 |
| Voidthread Weaver | Eclipse, Tempest, Bedrock | 3 |
| Roothold Keeper | Bedrock, Undertow, Crucible | 3 |
| Ironveil Watcher | Crucible, Basalt, Depths | 3 |
| Stoneheart Veteran | Crucible, Basalt, Bedrock | 3 |
| Vanguard of the Summit | Crucible, Basalt, Depths | 3 |
| Deepvault Keeper | Bedrock, Crucible, Undertow | 3 |
| Everhold Protector | Depths, Crucible, Basalt | 3 |
| Ashen Threshold | Mirage, Cinder, Bedrock | 3 |
| Voidthorn Protector | Depths, Gale, Cinder | 3 |
| Kindlespark Harvester | Crucible, Cinder, Depths | 3 |
| Risen Champion | Crucible, Bedrock, Cinder | 3 |
| Dreamtide Cartographer | Gale, Tempest, Eclipse | 3 |
| Nexus of Passing | Mirage, Cinder, Basalt | 3 |
| Archivist of Vanished Names | Tempest, Mirage, Undertow | 3 |
| Ironbark Warden | Crucible, Depths | 2 |
| Tidechannel Observer | Undertow, Cinder, Eclipse | 3 |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Depths, Gale, Tempest | 3 |

**Average archetypes per new card: 2.92** (up from v1's ~1.8)

This is a dramatic improvement. Every single new card serves at least 2 archetypes, and 24 of 25 serve 3. The design principle of multi-archetype reach has been executed exceptionally well.

## 2. V1 vs V2 Comparison

### Archetype Grades

| Archetype | V1 Grade | V2 Grade | Change | Key Improvement |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Tempest | A | 8.2/10 (A-) | Lateral | Homogeneity problem addressed; Stormtide Oracle adds cumulative scaling |
| Mirage | A- | 8.2/10 (A-) | Stable | Tideweaver Adept is a top-tier signpost |
| Basalt | A- | 7.8/10 (B+) | Slight drop | Lost dual signpost count (3 to 1); auto-build risk slightly increased |
| Cinder | A- | 8.4/10 (A) | Improved | Ashfire Ritualist is excellent; Tidechannel Observer adds new axis |
| Undertow | B+ | 8.2/10 (A-) | Improved | Abyssal Reclaimer signpost + void velocity scoring via Tidechannel Observer |
| Crucible | B+ | 7.6/10 (B+) | Stable | Rails score dropped from 9/10 to 6/10 (major improvement); purity-vs-power tension real |
| Eclipse | B | 7.2/10 (B) | Improved | Voidthread Weaver provides the discard engine Eclipse needed; "thin payoff layer" resolved |
| Bedrock | B- | 6.8/10 (B) | Improved | Roothold Keeper + Deepvault Keeper economic engine; Risen Champion for Warrior recursion |
| Depths | C+ | 7.0/10 (B-) | Improved | Watcher of the Fathoms resolves the critical signpost problem |
| Gale | C+ | 7.2/10 (B) | Improved | Windstride Runner resolves relative signpost deficit |

### Distribution Balance Improvements

| Metric | V1 | V2 | Change |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| Mono-Stone count | 31 | 40 | +9 (deficit closed) |
| Dual cards | 28 (variable, 1-4 per archetype) | 10 (exactly 1 per archetype) | Standardized |
| Smallest pool (Depths) | Not documented as a concern | 105 | All pools now 105-115 |
| Largest pool (Cinder) | Not documented | 115 | Spread of only 10 cards |

### Signpost Coverage

| Archetype | V1 Duals | V2 Duals | Change |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Tempest | 4 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Mirage | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Undertow | 4 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Depths | 1 (CRITICAL) | 1 (standardized) | Now at parity with all others |
| Gale | 1 (CRITICAL) | 1 (standardized) | Now at parity with all others |
| Eclipse | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Basalt | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Crucible | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Cinder | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |
| Bedrock | 3 | 1 | Reduced but purpose-built |

The v1 QA report called Depths (1 dual) and Gale (1 dual) "CRITICAL failures" because they were far below the 3-4 minimum for enemy pairs while other archetypes had 3-4. V2's policy of exactly 1 per archetype resolves the *relative* deficit by leveling the field. No archetype is disadvantaged relative to any other. However, the absolute dual count is lower -- archetypes that had 3-4 now have 1. The tradeoff is that each signpost is purpose-built and higher quality.

### Stone Deficit

| Metric | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Mono-Stone | 31 | 40 |
| New Stone cards | 0 | 7 |
| Shifts into Stone | 3 (Ethereal Courser, Angel, Pyrestone Avatar) | +3 more (Cloaked Sentinel to Stone, Starcatcher to Stone, Surge of Fury from dual to mono-Stone) |

The Stone deficit was the v1 QA report's #3 problem. It is fully resolved in v2 -- Stone now sits at 40, within the 38-45 target range.

### Bedrock Fragility

| Metric | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Core cards | 23 | ~30-35 (with expanded accessible pool of 110) |
| Void-only characters | 1 (Revenant of the Lost) | 3 (Revenant, Roothold Keeper, Risen Champion) |
| Cost reduction for void plays | None | Deepvault Keeper (1 less) |
| Grade | B- | B (6.8/10) |

Improved but still the weakest archetype. The fundamental two-piece combo dependency (fill void + find enablers) remains.

### Rails Scores

| Archetype | V1 Rails | V2 Rails | Change |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Crucible | 9/10 (critical) | 6/10 | Major improvement -- purity-vs-power tension works |
| Basalt | ~7/10 | 6/10 (flexibility score) | Moderate improvement |
| Cinder | ~5/10 | 7/10 (flexibility) | Within healthy range |
| Tempest | ~6/10 | 7/10 (flexibility) | "Slow Burn" build is a genuinely new path |
| Mirage | ~4/10 | 8/10 (flexibility) | Two distinct builds (Tempo vs Engine) |
| Undertow | ~5/10 | 8/10 (flexibility) | Survivor Swarm vs Void Engine are distinct |
| Eclipse | ~3-4/10 | 6/10 (flexibility) | Improved but still the most linear discard archetype |
| Gale | ~4/10 | 6/10 (flexibility) | Musician Crescendo vs Scorched Earth |
| Depths | ~5/10 | 7/10 (flexibility) | Fortress Control vs Midrange Value |
| Bedrock | ~3/10 | 7/10 (flexibility) | Crypt Engine vs Warrior Undying |

## 3. Regressions

### Regression 1: Reduced Absolute Dual Signpost Count

V1 gave some archetypes 3-4 dual signposts. V2 gives every archetype exactly 1. Archetypes that previously benefited from multiple dual signals (Tempest with 4, Undertow with 4, Eclipse with 3, Basalt with 3, Crucible with 3, Cinder with 3) now have fewer explicit dual-resonance cards pulling drafters into the archetype. The purpose-built signposts are individually higher quality, but the sheer signal volume is lower.

**Impact:** Moderate. The v2 signposts are strong build-around cards, but a drafter who does not see their single signpost has fewer alternative dual cards to read as "this archetype is open." Mono-color signals must carry more of the load.

### Regression 2: Starcatcher Lost from Tempest

The Tempest health check explicitly flags this: Starcatcher moved from Ember to Stone, meaning Tempest (Tide+Ember) can no longer access it. Starcatcher's "when you play event, gain 1 energy" was an energy-positive loop enabler for the storm engine. Its loss reduces Tempest's self-sustaining capability.

**Impact:** Medium. The Tempest health check identifies this as a genuine allocation error -- the allocation document lists Starcatcher with "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" but assigns it to Stone, which Tempest cannot access. This needs to be flagged for correction.

### Regression 3: Basalt's Auto-Build Risk Slightly Increased

With 33 on-plan cards in a format requiring ~25-card decks, Basalt risks drafting itself with minimal decision-making. V1's 3 dual signposts (Conduit of Resonance, Blazing Emberwing, Verdant Packmother) created more variety; v2's single signpost means less structural diversity in Basalt builds. The new non-SA Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit) partially offset this by creating genuine "dilute tribal for power" decisions, but the core tribal package is so deep that marginal decisions are mostly "which Spirit Animal over which Spirit Animal."

**Impact:** Low-Moderate. The 6/10 deckbuilding flexibility score reflects this -- lowest among archetypes except Eclipse and Gale.

### Regression 4: Some Cross-Pollination Cards Are Inaccessible to Target Archetypes

Three cards designed with Gale as a listed archetype are NOT in Gale's accessible pool:
- Duskwatch Vigil (mono-Tide, Gale cannot access)
- Voidthorn Protector (mono-Ruin, Gale cannot access)
- Dreamtide Cartographer (mono-Tide, Gale cannot access)

Similarly, Dreamtide Cartographer lists Eclipse as a primary archetype, but Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) cannot access mono-Tide cards.

And Ashen Threshold lists Bedrock as a primary archetype, but Bedrock (Stone+Ruin) cannot access mono-Ember cards.

**Impact:** Medium. This represents a design intent failure -- cards were designed for archetypes that cannot draft them. Gale is the most affected, receiving only 3 directly accessible new cards (Windstride Runner, Ashen Threshold, Nexus of Passing) versus the 5 that were "designed for" it.

---

## 4. Archetype Grades

### A Tier

**Cinder: A (8.4/10)**
Justification: Deepest sacrifice engine in the format. 18+ abandon cards, excellent recursion pipeline, Ashfire Ritualist is a model signpost. Two distinct builds (Sacrifice Engine vs Dissolved Aristocrats). Draft signals are the clearest in the format. Main weakness is fodder scarcity and Ruin Survivor noise.

**Mirage: A- (8.2/10)**
Justification: ~25-card mechanical core spanning enablers, targets, and payoffs. Tideweaver Adept is a top-3 signpost. Flicker engine is intuitive and self-sustaining. Two builds (Tempo Flicker vs Engine Flicker). Weakened by removal dependency on neutral pool and Pallid Arbiter vulnerability.

**Undertow: A- (8.2/10)**
Justification: Deepest core in the format with redundant mill + payoff + recursion. Abyssal Reclaimer is a well-designed conditional signpost. Two builds (Survivor Swarm vs Void Engine). Over-reliance on Soulkindler and vulnerability to void-banish effects are the main constraints.

**Tempest: A- (8.2/10)**
Justification: Deepest event engine infrastructure. Stormtide Oracle successfully addresses the "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem from v1. Two genuinely distinct builds (Big Storm vs Slow Burn). Starcatcher accessibility error and high Legendary dependency are concerns.

### B Tier

**Basalt: B+ (7.8/10)**
Justification: 33+ on-plan cards, excellent tribal density. Spirit Animal + energy ramp pipeline is tight. However, the auto-build convergence reduces draft replay value (6/10 flexibility), and mass removal fragility is significant. Stoneveil Guardian is functional but not splashy.

**Crucible: B+ (7.6/10)**
Justification: Rails score dramatically improved from 9/10 to 6/10 through non-Warrior power pieces. Forgeborn Martyr is an excellent signpost. The purity-vs-power tension is well-calibrated. Still the most linear archetype, and Warrior recursion requiring Ruin access is a structural weakness.

**Eclipse: B (7.2/10)**
Justification: "Thin payoff layer" problem from v1 is resolved -- now has 11 dedicated discard payoffs + Voidthread Weaver engine. Clean draft signals. Weakness: all payoffs concentrated in Ruin, limited removal, deckbuilding on a single axis.

**Gale: B (7.2/10)**
Justification: Deepest fast-card density in the format. Clear mechanical identity. Windstride Runner fixes the relative signpost deficit. Weakness: 3 design-target cards are inaccessible, Musician subtype concentration risk (only 4 cards), deckbuilding linearity.

**Depths: B- (7.0/10)**
Justification: Watcher of the Fathoms resolves the critical signpost problem and creates a unique play pattern. Duskwatch Vigil converts Prevents into tempo. Weakness: Stone pool dilution (only ~20 of 40 Stone cards serve Depths), lowest accessible pool (105), draft signal clarity is weakest (6/10).

### C Tier

**Bedrock: C+ (6.8/10)**
Justification: Massive improvement from v1's 23-card core to 110-card accessible pool. Roothold Keeper + Deepvault Keeper create a viable economic engine. Risen Champion adds Warrior recursion. But mechanical coherence is the weakest (6/10) -- Stone and Ruin pull in very different directions. Still the archetype most likely to trainwreck when key pieces are missing. Effective Stone contribution is only 10-15 cards out of 40.

---

## 5. Synergy Density Metric

### V1 New Cards: Average ~1.8 Archetypes per Card

The v1 QA report noted that many new cards were narrowly targeted, with an average of approximately 1.8 archetypes genuinely wanting each card.

### V2 New Cards: Average 2.92 Archetypes per Card

| Archetypes Served | Cards | Count |
|-------------------|-------|-------|
| 2 archetypes | Ironbark Warden | 1 |
| 3 archetypes | All other 24 cards | 24 |

**Improvement: +62% synergy density (1.8 to 2.92)**

This is the single most impressive quantitative improvement from v1 to v2. Every new card was deliberately designed to serve multiple archetypes, and the execution is remarkably consistent -- 24 of 25 cards hit exactly 3 archetypes.

The only card below the average is Ironbark Warden (2 archetypes: Crucible and Depths), which is intentional -- its "since your last turn" mechanic creates anti-synergy with Zephyr flicker archetypes, narrowing its appeal by design.

---

## 6. Outstanding Issues

### Issue 1: Gale's 3 Inaccessible Design-Target Cards (Severity: HIGH)

Three cards listing Gale as a target archetype are not in Gale's accessible pool:
- **Duskwatch Vigil** (mono-Tide) -- "When you prevent, next event costs 2 less"
- **Voidthorn Protector** (mono-Ruin) -- "Abandon self: Prevent character"
- **Dreamtide Cartographer** (mono-Tide) -- "3 or fewer in hand: draw 2"

This means Gale received the fewest directly-accessible new cards of any archetype: only 3 (Windstride Runner, Ashen Threshold, Nexus of Passing). Of these, only Windstride Runner was specifically designed for Gale.

**Recommended fix:** Either (a) change Dreamtide Cartographer from mono-Tide to mono-Zephyr (its hand-emptying draw mode is more Zephyr-coded than Tide-coded), or (b) design 1-2 new mono-Zephyr or mono-Ember cards explicitly for Gale's fast-tempo plan. The Duskwatch Vigil and Voidthorn Protector inaccessibility should be acknowledged in the archetype tags -- remove Gale from their primary archetype listings since Gale cannot draft them.

### Issue 2: Tempest's Starcatcher Allocation Error (Severity: MEDIUM)

The allocation document lists Starcatcher with "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" but assigns it to Stone (mono). Tempest (Tide+Ember) cannot access Stone cards. This is flagged by the Tempest health check as a genuine loss -- Starcatcher's "when you play event, gain 1 energy" was a key storm enabler.

**Recommended fix:** Either (a) move Starcatcher back to Ember (restoring Tempest access, but this was moved to Stone to address the Stone deficit), (b) remove Tempest from Starcatcher's primary archetype listing (acknowledging the loss), or (c) create a new Ember card with event-triggered energy to fill the gap Starcatcher left.

### Issue 3: Bedrock's Continued Fragility (Severity: MEDIUM)

Despite improvements, Bedrock remains the weakest archetype:
- Mechanical coherence is lowest at 6/10 (Stone and Ruin pull in very different directions)
- Only ~10-15 of 40 Stone cards serve Bedrock's core plan
- Key Ruin cards (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) are contested by 3-4 archetypes
- The reanimator plan requires both filling the void AND finding enablers -- a two-piece combo that can be fragile
- No fast-speed interaction from the core plan
- Top-heavy mana curve

**Recommended fix:** Consider 1-2 more Stone cards that specifically bridge to void play (e.g., a Stone event that mills, or a Stone character with "when you play from void" triggers). The existing Deepvault Keeper is the sole Stone-Bedrock bridge.

### Issue 4: Ruin and Ember at 45 Cards Each (Ceiling) (Severity: LOW)

Both Ruin and Ember sit at exactly 45 mono cards, the ceiling of the 38-45 target range. While this is technically passing, it means no further cards can be added to either resonance without exceeding the ceiling. Given that Ruin serves 4 archetypes and Ember serves 4 archetypes, this ceiling could become constraining if future card additions are needed.

### Issue 5: Eclipse's Dreamtide Cartographer Inaccessibility (Severity: LOW-MEDIUM)

Dreamtide Cartographer lists Eclipse as a primary archetype, but Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) cannot access mono-Tide cards. Eclipse's hand-emptying discard plan would benefit from the draw mode, but the card is architecturally inaccessible. This is the same class of error as the Gale inaccessibility problem.

### Issue 6: No New Events in the 25-Card Batch (Severity: LOW)

All 25 new cards are characters (24 regular + 1 fast character). Zero events were added. While characters are the primary card type in the format, the absence of any new events means event-centric archetypes (Tempest, Depths) received no new tools in their primary card type. This is not critical but is worth noting for future batches.

### Issue 7: Basalt Auto-Build Convergence (Severity: LOW)

With 33+ on-plan cards for ~25-card decks, Basalt risks feeling like it "drafts itself." The two builds (Spirit Engine vs Judgment Storm) are different configurations but share most of the same card pool. This is a structural feature of tribal archetypes rather than a design failure, but it may reduce draft replay value.

---

## 7. Recommendations for Round 10

### Priority 1: Fix Gale's Accessibility Gap

Gale is the archetype most underserved by v2's new cards. Three cards designed for it are inaccessible. The Design Council should:

1. **Move Dreamtide Cartographer from mono-Tide to mono-Zephyr.** The hand-emptying draw mode is Zephyr's tempo identity, not Tide's information identity. This single change gives Gale, Mirage, Basalt, and Eclipse access (all Zephyr archetypes) while removing Tempest, Undertow, and Depths access (Tide-only archetypes). Tempest loses a supplementary card but has 9/10 core depth already. This is the highest-impact single change available.

2. **Clean up primary archetype tags.** Remove Gale from Duskwatch Vigil and Voidthorn Protector's primary archetype listings, since Gale cannot draft them. This prevents future confusion.

### Priority 2: Resolve the Starcatcher Contradiction

Starcatcher's archetype tag says "Tempest, Basalt" but its resonance (Stone) makes it inaccessible to Tempest. Either:

- **Option A:** Accept the loss and remove Tempest from the tag. Tempest's 9/10 core depth suggests it can absorb this.
- **Option B:** Create a new mono-Ember card that provides event-triggered energy, explicitly designed for Tempest. Something like: "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" on a 3-cost body. This fills the specific gap without disrupting Stone's count.

Option A is lower effort and Tempest is healthy enough to absorb the loss. Option B is better long-term design.

### Priority 3: Shore Up Bedrock with 1-2 Targeted Cards

Bedrock's 6.8/10 average is the lowest in the format. The most impactful improvements would be:

1. **A Stone card that cares about void play.** Currently only Deepvault Keeper bridges Stone to Bedrock's identity. A second card -- perhaps "When you materialize a character from your void, gain 2 energy" on a Stone body -- would significantly improve the mechanical coherence between Bedrock's two halves.

2. **A cheaper reanimation target in Ruin.** Bedrock's payoffs are top-heavy (Revenant at 3 from void, Titan at 6, The Rising God at 9, The Devourer at 8). A 2-cost void-only character with 2-3 spark would give the archetype a faster clock.

However, both Ruin and Stone are at or near their ceiling counts (45 and 40 respectively). Any additions would need to be offset by cuts or by raising the ceiling.

### Priority 4: Consider Gale-Specific Fast-Matters Support

Gale's Musician package is only 4 cards deep. If any of them are taken by other drafters, Gale loses significant payoff infrastructure. Consider:

1. **A new Ember card with a fast-matters trigger.** Currently Gale's fast payoffs are entirely in Zephyr (Musicians). An Ember card that rewards playing fast cards would give Gale redundancy across both its resonances. Something like: "When you play a fast card, kindle 1" on a 2-cost Ember body.

2. **Alternatively, a new neutral fast-matters payoff** that any archetype could use but Gale benefits from disproportionately.

### Priority 5: Monitor Format-Level Health

The v2 changes are healthy overall. The format's biggest macro-level risk is that Ruin archetypes (Undertow, Eclipse, Cinder, Bedrock) all compete for 3 shared infrastructure cards (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths). In a draft pod with 2+ Ruin drafters, these cards will be fought over aggressively. The sub-theme differentiation works for most of the Ruin pool, but these 3 pinch points remain.

No action is recommended for this -- it creates healthy draft tension rather than design failure. But it should be monitored in playtesting to ensure no single Ruin archetype consistently dominates access to these cards.

---

## Summary

V2 represents a substantial improvement over v1 across nearly every metric:

- **Stone deficit:** Fully resolved (31 to 40).
- **Signpost equity:** All archetypes now have exactly 1 purpose-built dual signpost.
- **Crucible linearity:** Rails score dropped from 9/10 to 6/10 through non-Warrior power pieces.
- **Tempest homogeneity:** Stormtide Oracle's cumulative scaling and the "Slow Burn" build create genuine variety.
- **Eclipse depth:** Voidthread Weaver provides the discard engine the archetype was missing.
- **Bedrock fragility:** Roothold Keeper + Deepvault Keeper create a viable economic engine.
- **Depths/Gale signpost gaps:** Resolved at the relative level (all archetypes at parity).
- **Synergy density:** Average archetypes per new card jumped from 1.8 to 2.92.

The three most impactful remaining issues are:
1. Gale's inaccessible design-target cards (3 cards designed for Gale that Gale cannot draft)
2. Starcatcher's archetype tag contradiction
3. Bedrock's continued fragility as the weakest archetype

These are addressable in Round 10 without requiring wholesale restructuring. The v2 resonance system is fundamentally sound and ready for playtesting with minor corrections.
