# The Drafter's Eye: Archetype Discovery & Draft Tension Analysis (v2)

## Methodology

I approached each archetype as a drafter encountering it for the first time, asking: How many picks does it take before I know exactly what I am building? Are there any genuine "aha" moments, or is the path obvious from pick 1? Which cards create multi-archetype tension, and which are dead-obvious single-archetype slots?

For each archetype, I evaluated the experience of opening or being passed key cards, and how quickly the archetype identity resolves. I drew extensively from the 222 existing cards in cards_dense.txt, the 18 new cards in final_allocation.md, and the archetype files.

## Individual Archetype Analysis

---

### 1. CRUCIBLE (Stone+Ember) -- Warrior Tribal/Lords

**Rails Score: 9/10** (most on-rails in the format)

**Draft Experience:** You open Skyflame Commander ("Allied Warriors have +1 spark"). You are now a Crucible drafter. That is the entire decision. Every subsequent pick is "Is this a Warrior? Does it say 'Warrior' on it? Take it." The Warrior lords (Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity, Company Commander, Assault Leader) are so mechanically narrow that they function as neon signs. Seeker for the Way tutors Warriors. Fury of the Clan kills things based on Warrior count. Summons of the Bonded discovers Warriors. The archetype is self-contained to an extreme degree.

**Discovery Moments:** Almost none in the core. The closest thing to a discovery is realizing Frost Visionary (a Warrior with "Materialized: Draw 1") is better in Mirage than in Crucible -- but that is a *negative* discovery for the Crucible drafter (losing a card), not a positive one. Surge of Fury ("trigger an additional Judgment phase") creates a minor discovery moment when you realize it doubles your entire Warrior lord board, not just one trigger. But mostly, if the card says "Warrior," you take it.

The Warrior-sacrifice bridge cards (Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, The Dread Sovereign, Blade of Oblivion, Grim Reclaimer) provide the only genuine tension point: "Am I Crucible with a sacrifice subtheme, or am I actually Cinder?" This is a real decision, but it resolves quickly.

**Draft Tension:** The Warrior-sacrifice bridge is the one healthy tension zone. Forsworn Champion ("Abandon an ally: +1 spark") is genuinely wanted by both Crucible (Warrior body) and Cinder (sacrifice outlet). The Dread Sovereign is an excellent dual-demand card -- both archetypes want it for completely different reasons (Crucible for the Warrior upgrade chain, Cinder for the abandon trigger). Bloomweaver creates minor Stone-axis tension between Crucible and Basalt.

**Signal Clarity:** Far too clear. Warrior lords are so narrow that picking one is tantamount to declaring your archetype. No other archetype will ever pick Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity, or Company Commander. This means Crucible is either wide open (in which case you steamroll) or contested by exactly one opponent (in which case you knife-fight over a narrow card pool). There is almost no graceful pivot out of Crucible once you have committed.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Skyflame Commander (literally only Crucible)
- Blade of Unity (literally only Crucible)
- Company Commander (literally only Crucible)
- Summons of the Bonded (literally only Crucible)
- Spirit Bond equivalent for Warriors -- Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade

---

### 2. BASALT (Zephyr+Stone) -- Ramp/Spirit Animal Tribal

**Rails Score: 8/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Spiritbound Alpha ("Judgment: pay 4, each Spirit Animal gains +2 spark"), Spirit Bond (12-energy tribal finisher), or Mystic Runefish ("3 energy: each Spirit Animal becomes 5 spark"). You are now a Basalt drafter. Similar to Crucible, the tribal payoff cards are so narrow that picking them immediately locks you in. Ghostlight Wolves ("Judgment: gain 1 energy per Spirit Animal") is another unmistakable signal.

The difference from Crucible's 9/10 is that Basalt has a genuine second axis: the materialize-matters cluster. Cards like Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, and Lumin-Gate Seer are *shared* with Mirage, creating a real question: "Am I Basalt deploying Spirit Animals, or Mirage flickering for value?" This is a meaningful draft fork that Crucible entirely lacks.

**Discovery Moments:** The Conduit of Resonance / Blazing Emberwing engine creates a legitimate "wait, what?" moment. Realizing that Conduit ("When you materialize a character, trigger Judgment abilities of each ally") collapses the materialize-and-Judgment loop is a genuine strategic discovery -- suddenly every Spirit Animal with a Judgment trigger becomes twice as valuable. This is the best discovery moment of any tribal archetype.

Verdant Packmother (new dual signpost) is well-designed as a card that makes you *want* to be in Basalt rather than just being in Basalt because you opened the lords.

**Draft Tension:** Strong tension with Mirage over the materialize-matters cluster. Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer, Mirrorlight Architect, Radiant Trio, and Endless Projection are all genuinely contested between two archetypes that want them for different mechanical reasons. This is healthy. Nexus Wayfinder creates 4-way tension (Basalt, Depths, Bedrock, Crucible) as a generic ramp piece, which is excellent.

Looming Oracle and Shadowpaw are Spirit Animals that Mirage wants as flicker targets -- genuine inter-archetype tension on tribal members.

**Signal Clarity:** The tribal core (Spirit Animal lords) is too obvious, but the materialize-matters bridge provides enough ambiguity to create interesting picks 3-8. The ramp infrastructure (Stone-coded energy generators) could plausibly be Depths or Crucible picks, which adds useful noise.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Spirit Bond (only Basalt, 12-energy finisher)
- Mystic Runefish (only Basalt, Spirit Animal anthem)
- Spiritbound Alpha (only Basalt, Spirit Animal lord)
- Sunshadow Eagle (only Basalt, Spirit Animal materialize payoff)

---

### 3. GALE (Zephyr+Ember) -- Flash/Fast Tempo

**Rails Score: 7/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Sage of the Prelude ("When you play a fast card, draw 1"), Intermezzo Balladeer ("When you play a fast card, +2 spark"), or Melodist of the Finale ("When you play a fast card, gain 1 point"). You are now a Gale drafter. The Musician trio is extremely on-rails -- these three cards do literally nothing outside of a fast-matters deck. Moonlit Dancer ("Characters in hand have fast") and Keeper of the Tides ("Discover a fast event") reinforce the single-track nature.

However, Gale's *removal suite* creates real flexibility. Immolate, Shatter the Frail, Pyrokinetic Surge, Fell the Mighty, and Shattering Gambit are all fast removal events that *any* Ember deck could splash. A drafter who takes early fast removal does not know yet whether they are Gale (Zephyr+Ember), Cinder (Ember+Ruin), or Crucible (Stone+Ember). This is healthy.

**Discovery Moments:** Moonlit Dancer is the best discovery card in Gale. The moment you realize "Characters in hand have fast" means you can play any character at instant speed -- suddenly every Materialized trigger in your deck becomes a combat trick. A drafter who picks up Moonlit Dancer mid-pack and realizes their Frost Visionary or Keeper of Forgotten Light is now a fast-speed value play has a genuine "aha" moment.

Herald of the Last Light ("Fast -- Abandon this: Prevent an event") also creates a discovery: it is simultaneously a fast card (triggers Musicians), a Prevent effect (control), and a sacrifice body (Cinder). Realizing it does all three at once is satisfying.

**Draft Tension:** The fast removal suite creates excellent tension between Gale, Cinder, Crucible, and Depths (as splash). Immolate is wanted by basically every Ember-adjacent drafter. Fell the Mighty has the "banish from hand" alternative cost that makes it appealing to Depths as well. Pyrokinetic Surge bridges Gale and Cinder through its abandon/discard alternative cost.

The Musician trio, however, creates *zero* tension -- nobody else wants them.

**Signal Clarity:** The Musician core is too clear. But the supporting cast (fast characters, fast removal) is appropriately ambiguous, creating a 7/10 rails score rather than the 9/10 of Crucible.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Sage of the Prelude (only Gale, fast-matters draw)
- Intermezzo Balladeer (only Gale, fast-matters spark)
- Melodist of the Finale (only Gale, fast-matters points)
- Sundown Surfer (only Gale, opponent's-turn spark)
- Keeper of the Tides (only Gale, fast event discovery)

---

### 4. DEPTHS (Tide+Stone) -- Control

**Rails Score: 6/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Abolish ("Prevent a played card") early. Are you Depths? Maybe. Or you could be any Tide deck splashing a Prevent. You take Infernal Rest, Ripple of Defiance, Cragfall. Okay, you are picking up a lot of Prevent effects. By pick 4-5, the density of Prevents signals Depths. But individual Prevent cards are generic Tide tools that Tempest, Mirage, or even Gale might want as 1-of splashes. This ambiguity is good.

The hand disruption suite (Break the Veil, Lurking Dread, Wraith of Twisting Shadows) is more specifically Depths. Taking a hand disruption card alongside Prevents strongly narrows you to Depths.

**Discovery Moments:** Pallid Arbiter ("Disable Materialized abilities of enemies") is a genuine metagame discovery card. Against Mirage, it is devastating. Against Crucible, it does almost nothing. The "oh wait, this shuts down their entire strategy" realization is a satisfying draft discovery. Voidshield Guardian ("Prevent events that could dissolve an ally") is similar -- narrow but devastating when relevant.

Tidestone Arbiter (new dual signpost: "Judgment: Draw 1. Opponent's characters cost 1 more") combines card advantage and tax in a way that creates a "this is exactly what I need" discovery for a control drafter who has been picking up Prevents and disruption.

**Draft Tension:** Excellent multi-archetype tension. Keeper of Forgotten Light is genuinely contested between Depths (control finisher) and Mirage (flicker target). Cosmic Puppeteer is contested the same way. Nexus Wayfinder is wanted by 4 archetypes. The Waking Titan creates tension between Depths and Bedrock.

The Prevent suite itself creates minor tension with Gale (2-3 splash Prevents) and with any Tide deck. This is healthy -- individual Prevents are good cards that everyone wants, but only Depths wants *nine* of them.

**Signal Clarity:** Appropriately unclear. Depths resolves gradually (picks 3-6) rather than instantly (pick 1). The control identity emerges from accumulating Prevents and disruption, not from any single card screaming "DEPTHS." This is the ideal draft experience.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Pallid Arbiter (anti-Materialized tech, basically only Depths)
- Cloaked Sentinel (anti-event tax, mostly Depths)
- Maelstrom Denial (Prevent a fast card specifically, very narrow)

---

### 5. TEMPEST (Tide+Ember) -- Spellslinger/Storm

**Rails Score: 5/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Echo Architect ("Events cost 2 more. Copy played events") or Cascade of Reflections ("Until end of turn, copy every event"). These signal storm, but they are expensive build-arounds. Early Tempest picks are often generic energy events (Genesis Burst, Flash of Power) or generic draw (Data Pulse, Echoes of the Journey) that could go into any deck. The storm identity solidifies when you accumulate 3+ event-copying or cards-played-matters effects.

Storm Conduit (new: "When you play an event, gain 1 energy. 3rd event: draw 2") and Resonance Spark (new: "1 cost, gain 1 energy, draw 1, conditional +1 energy") are good signposts that signal Tempest without being useless outside it.

**Discovery Moments:** The "cards played this turn" family creates genuine discovery. Illumination of Glory ("gain 1 point per card played this turn") looks mediocre until you realize a 6-card storm turn is 6 points. Echoes of the Journey ("draw 1 per card played") looks fine until you realize it is a massive chain-sustainer mid-storm. Packcaller of Shadows ("materialize a figment per card played") creates a "wait, I can flood the board from a spell chain?" realization.

The event-copying cards create compounding discoveries: Echoes of Eternity ("copy next event 3 times") combined with Illumination of Glory means the copied events ALSO count as "cards played this turn." The math of storm chains is inherently discovery-rich.

Leyline Detonation (new: "gain energy equal to events in void") is an interesting discovery card -- it rewards having played many events across the game, not just this turn, creating a different angle on the storm payoff.

**Draft Tension:** Excellent. Energy burst events (Genesis Burst, Flash of Power, Arc Gate Opening) are wanted by Tempest for storm fuel but also by Basalt and Depths for ramp. Guiding Light and Epiphany Unfolded are generic Tide draw wanted by everyone. Starcatcher is wanted by Tempest specifically but Keeper of the Lightpath is flex for Depths too. Ashlight Caller bridges Tempest and Undertow.

Whisper of the Past ("event in void gains Reclaim 0") is a satisfying discovery card -- in Tempest, it recovers a spent combo piece; in Bedrock, it recovers Entomb or Path to Redemption. Different archetypes want it for different reasons.

**Signal Clarity:** Well-calibrated. The event-copying cards are strong signals, but cheap events and energy cards are appropriately ambiguous. Storm resolves gradually across picks 3-6.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Echo Architect (only Tempest, event-copy engine)
- Cascade of Reflections (only Tempest, event-copy burst)
- Echoes of Eternity (only Tempest, event-copy extreme)
- Illumination of Glory (only Tempest, cards-played-this-turn points finisher)
- Spirit of Smoldering Echoes (only Tempest, events-in-void spark scaling)

Five single-archetype cards is high for an enemy pair. The event-copying subpackage is particularly insular.

---

### 6. CINDER (Ember+Ruin) -- Aristocrats/Sacrifice/Abandon

**Rails Score: 5/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Harvester of Despair ("When you abandon an ally, +1 spark") or Infernal Ascendant ("When you abandon an ally, kindle 2"). These signal sacrifice, but you do not yet know if you are Cinder (Ember+Ruin, full aristocrats) or just an aggressive Ember deck splashing sacrifice. The Cinder identity crystallizes when you pick up Ruin-coded dissolved triggers -- Volcanic Channeler ("When an ally is dissolved, gain 1 energy"), Avatar of Cosmic Reckoning ("When an ally is dissolved, gain 1 point"), or Sunset Chronicler ("When an ally is dissolved, draw 1"). The combination of Ember abandon payoffs + Ruin dissolved triggers is what makes Cinder specifically.

**Discovery Moments:** Several strong ones. Obliterator of Worlds ("Abandon an ally: Play for 0, abandon self. Materialized: Dissolve an enemy.") generates TWO abandon triggers for zero energy -- realizing this chains with Harvester of Despair for +2 spark AND removes an enemy is a genuine "that's filthy" discovery.

Spirit Reaping ("Abandon an ally: Gain energy equal to cost") creates discovery when combined with Exiles of the Last Light ("Abandon an ally: Kindle 1") -- you sacrifice the same creature to both abilities if you have them on board, netting energy AND kindle AND triggering any abandoned/dissolved payoffs.

Momentum of the Fallen ("Dissolve an enemy, draw 1. Costs 1 if a character dissolved this turn.") is a beautiful discovery -- realizing you can sacrifice a creature, trigger dissolved payoffs, then cast this for 1 energy to remove an enemy AND draw is the quintessential Cinder dream sequence.

**Draft Tension:** Very strong. The Warrior-sacrifice bridge (Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, The Dread Sovereign, Blade of Oblivion, Grim Reclaimer) creates genuine tension with Crucible. Both archetypes want these cards equally but for different reasons. Dustborn Veteran and Sunset Chronicler are co-primary between Cinder and Undertow. Resilient Wanderer bridges Cinder and Undertow. Starlit Cascade bridges Cinder and Mirage. These are all healthy tension points.

The Ember removal suite (Immolate, Pyrokinetic Surge) is shared with Gale, creating Ember-axis tension.

**Signal Clarity:** Well-balanced. Abandon payoffs are Cinder-specific but early Ember picks could be going anywhere (Crucible, Gale, Cinder). The archetype resolves when Ruin dissolved triggers appear alongside Ember sacrifice outlets.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Fathomless Maw (mostly only Cinder, abandon-for-points)
- The Forsaker (mostly only Cinder, once-per-turn sacrifice for points)
- Shardwoven Tyrant (mostly only Cinder, sacrifice-scaled removal)
- Prophet of the Consumed (mostly only Cinder, draw per abandon)

---

### 7. UNDERTOW (Tide+Ruin) -- Self-Mill/Survivor Tribal

**Rails Score: 5/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Flagbearer of Decay ("Play a Survivor: mill 2") or Searcher in the Mists ("Materialized/Dissolved: mill 4"). These signal self-mill, but self-mill is also wanted by Bedrock (to fill void with reanimation targets). The Survivor tribal payoffs -- Soulkindler ("If in void, Survivors have +2 spark"), Veil of the Wastes ("When you materialize a Survivor, Reclaim this"), Hope's Vanguard ("With 2+ Survivors, draw 1") -- are what lock you into Undertow specifically.

However, Undertow has an unusual dynamic: Soulkindler *wants* to be in your void, not your hand. The discovery that your lord is better when milled than when drawn is a genuinely interesting inversion of the typical tribal draft experience.

**Discovery Moments:** Strong. Soulkindler is the standout discovery -- the moment you realize you want to mill your own lord is satisfying. Twilight Reclaimer ("Dissolved: a Survivor in void gains Reclaim equal to cost") creates a chain-recursion discovery when combined with other Dissolved triggers. Silent Avenger and Seer of the Fallen create a "death is a feature, not a bug" realization when you see how many triggers fire when a Survivor dies.

Architect of Memory ("Void >= 7: all cards have Reclaim equal to cost") is a discovery bomb -- the moment you realize this turns your entire void into a second hand is transformative. But this card is 3-way contested (Undertow/Eclipse/Bedrock), so it creates as much draft tension as discovery.

**Draft Tension:** The 3-way void-infrastructure contest (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) is the format's best tension point. Three archetypes want these cards for different mechanical reasons: Undertow for void-size scaling, Eclipse for discard cycling, Bedrock for reanimation. Whoever takes Architect of Memory sends a strong signal about their archetype.

The Survivor tribal core is narrow enough that it mostly avoids competition, but Dustborn Veteran and Sunset Chronicler are co-primary with Cinder, creating healthy tension.

Harvest the Forgotten creates tension between Undertow (core self-mill) and Bedrock (void-filling) and even Tempest (cheap cantrip).

**Signal Clarity:** Good. Individual mill cards or Survivor bodies are not unambiguous Undertow signals, but the combination of both is. The archetype resolves across picks 2-5.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Soulkindler (only Undertow, void-lord for Survivors)
- Veil of the Wastes (only Undertow, Survivor-triggered self-Reclaim)
- Through the Rift (only Undertow, Discover a Survivor)
- Kindred Sparks (mostly Undertow, Survivor void-play)

---

### 8. MIRAGE (Tide+Zephyr) -- Blink/Flicker

**Rails Score: 4/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Flickerveil Adept ("Judgment: Banish ally spark 2 or less, materialize it") or Blooming Path Wanderer ("Judgment: Banish ally, materialize it"). These signal flicker, but flicker enablers could also support Basalt (flickering Spirit Animals for Judgment triggers). The *targets* you pair with flicker enablers determine your archetype: Materialized-draw targets (Frost Visionary, Keeper of Forgotten Light, Looming Oracle) point to Mirage; Spirit Animal energy generators (Ghostlight Wolves, Luminwings) point to Basalt.

This is excellent draft design. The flicker enablers are shared infrastructure, and the targets you draft around them determine your archetype. A drafter can stay open on the Mirage/Basalt axis for multiple picks.

**Discovery Moments:** The best in the format. Aurora Rider ("Materialized: Banish any number of allies, materialize them") creates a "mass flicker is HOW MANY triggers??" realization. Starlit Cascade ("When an ally leaves play, gain 2 energy") combined with any flicker enabler creates "I make energy every time I flicker??" -- and if you pair it with Cosmic Puppeteer ("Materialized: Gain control of enemy cost 2 or less"), the discovery is that you can steal an enemy, flicker it back, and steal another one.

Mirrorlight Architect ("4 energy: Materialize a copy of an ally") creates discovery in Mirage: copying your Frost Visionary means two draw triggers per flicker cycle. Celestial Reverie ("When you play a character, draw 1") combined with mass-bounce (Key to the Moment) creates a "return 4 allies, draw 4, replay them, draw 4 more" chain discovery.

Veil Dancer (new: "When an ally's Materialized ability triggers, Foresee 1") is a subtle but rewarding card -- each flicker now also filters your draws, compounding value in a non-obvious way.

**Draft Tension:** Exceptional. The materialize-matters cluster (Angel of the Eclipse, The Bondweaver, Lumin-Gate Seer, Mirrorlight Architect) is genuinely shared between Mirage and Basalt. Keeper of Forgotten Light is contested between Mirage and Depths. Frost Visionary bridges Mirage and Crucible. Starlit Cascade bridges Mirage and Cinder. Shadowpaw bridges Mirage and Basalt. These are all cards where two archetypes want the same card for mechanically distinct reasons.

**Signal Clarity:** Ideal. Early flicker enablers are ambiguous (Mirage or Basalt?). Materialized-draw targets narrow toward Mirage. The archetype resolves gradually across picks 3-7, with genuine fork decisions along the way.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Tideborne Voyager (mostly only Mirage, +1 spark when ally banished)
- Call to the Unknown (mostly only Mirage, Discover Materialized character)
- Key to the Moment (mostly only Mirage, mass self-bounce)

Mirage has very few single-archetype cards, which is excellent.

---

### 9. ECLIPSE (Zephyr+Ruin) -- Self-Discard Payoffs

**Rails Score: 3/10**

**Draft Experience:** You see Mother of Flames ("When you discard a card, kindle 1"). Is this Eclipse? Or is it just a card in any Ruin deck? You see Apocalypse Vigilante ("When you discard a card, gain 1 point"). Okay, there is a discard theme emerging, but you still need enablers. You pick up Chronicle Reclaimer ("Judgment: Draw 1, discard 1") or Fragments of Vision ("Draw 3, discard 2"). Now you have pieces from both Zephyr (cycling enablers) and Ruin (discard payoffs), and the archetype is starting to gel.

Eclipse is the format's most emergent archetype. No single card screams "ECLIPSE." The discard payoffs are Ruin-coded, and the discard enablers are Zephyr-coded. You discover the archetype by realizing your Zephyr cycling cards and your Ruin payoff cards want to be in the same deck. This is the ideal draft experience for an enemy pair.

**Discovery Moments:** The best emergent discovery in the format. Ashmaze Guide ("When you discard a card, it gains Reclaim equal to its cost") is the pivotal discovery card -- the moment you realize that discarding an expensive card gives it Reclaim, which means you can play it from the void later, is the "Eclipse click." Suddenly your draw-discard filtering is not card disadvantage; it is card *selection* plus void setup.

Ridge Vortex Explorer ("When you discard this character, materialize it") creates an amazing "wait, I throw this away and it comes into play??" discovery. This is the single best-designed card for archetype discovery in the format.

Nocturne ("Materialized: Draw 1, discard 1. Reclaim 3") is a triple discovery: it cycles (enabler), it self-Reclaims (repeatable), and it triggers all your discard payoffs. Realizing this is a self-contained engine piece is deeply satisfying.

Forgotten Titan ("5 cost, 3 spark. Costs 1 if you discarded this turn") creates a subtle discovery: in Eclipse, this is essentially a 1-cost, 3-spark body, because you are always discarding.

**Draft Tension:** Good but slightly narrow. Eclipse shares Ruin with Undertow, Cinder, and Bedrock, but the discard payoffs (Mother of Flames, Apocalypse Vigilante, Torchbearer) are Eclipse-exclusive. The *enablers* (Fragments of Vision, Skies of Change) are generic Zephyr cycling cards that Gale might also want. The 3-way contested Reclaim infrastructure (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption) creates healthy tension.

Rebirth Ritualist bridges Eclipse and Cinder cleanly. Wasteland Arbitrator bridges Eclipse and Gale. Secrets of the Deep bridges Eclipse and Gale.

**Signal Clarity:** Appropriately murky for an enemy pair. Individual discard payoffs or cycling enablers could belong to other archetypes. The Eclipse identity emerges only when you have *both* sides. This is exactly right.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Apocalypse Vigilante (mostly only Eclipse, discard-for-points)
- Torchbearer of the Abyss (mostly only Eclipse, discard-for-kindle+energy)
- Pattern Seeker (mostly only Eclipse, discard-to-draw+points)

Only 3 single-archetype cards is excellent for draft health.

---

### 10. BEDROCK (Stone+Ruin) -- Reanimator/Cheat Into Play

**Rails Score: 2/10** (most discovery-oriented in the format)

**Draft Experience:** Bedrock is the hardest archetype to identify during a draft. You see Revenant of the Lost ("3 cost, 6 spark. May only play from void"). This is an incredible signpost -- but where did it come from? You need to pair it with void-filling effects (Entomb, Harvest the Forgotten, Ashborn Necromancer) AND recursion effects (Path to Redemption, Architect of Memory, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) AND expensive reanimation targets (Titan of Forgotten Echoes, The Devourer, The Rising God). No single card defines Bedrock; the archetype emerges from the intersection of three card categories.

Bedrock drafters often look like Undertow or Depths drafters for the first 5-6 picks, then pivot when they realize they have the right combination of expensive bodies, void-filling, and recursion.

**Discovery Moments:** The most discovery-rich archetype. Entomb (new: "Put a character from hand into void. Draw 2") is the moment the archetype clicks -- "I can put Titan of Forgotten Echoes into my void ON PURPOSE and then bring it back cheaply?" This transforms Bedrock from "I hope I mill the right card" to "I control exactly what goes into my void."

Revenant of the Lost is a permanent discovery card -- it is only playable from the void, which means every time you see it, you think "how do I get this into the void?" This drives the entire Bedrock deckbuilding exercise.

The Devourer ("8 cost, 8 spark. Banish void with 8+: Reclaim") creates a discovery about void management -- "I need exactly 8 cards in void, then I get an 8-spark monster repeatedly?" The tension between building void count (for The Devourer and Architect of Memory) and spending void cards (for Eclipse Herald's banish cost or The Rising God's abandon cost) is a genuine strategic discovery.

Speaker for the Forgotten ("When you play a Warrior, Reclaim random cost 3 or less") creates a cross-archetype discovery -- realizing you can play Warriors (Crucible cards) to Reclaim Revenant of the Lost (Bedrock's signature body) bridges two apparently unrelated archetypes.

**Draft Tension:** Extreme. Almost every Bedrock card is contested. Architect of Memory and Path to Redemption are 3-way contested. Reclaimer of Lost Paths is contested with Undertow and Cinder. Harvest the Forgotten is contested with Undertow and Tempest. Nexus Wayfinder is contested 4 ways. Keeper of Forgotten Light is contested with Depths and Mirage. Ashmaze Guide is contested with Eclipse.

This is simultaneously Bedrock's greatest strength (draft interest) and greatest weakness (you may not get the cards you need). The archetype's "Moderate" depth rating in the proposal is accurate -- it is functional but fragile.

**Signal Clarity:** Very murky, possibly too murky. A drafter might not realize Bedrock is open because the individual cards look like they belong to other archetypes. The new dual signposts (Echoing Monolith, Revenant of the Lost as Stone+Ruin duals) help, but Bedrock may still be the format's most under-drafted archetype simply because it is hard to recognize.

**Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders:**
- Revenant of the Lost (only Bedrock, void-only 6-spark body)
- Echoing Monolith (mostly Bedrock, Reclaim 3 signpost)

Only 2 single-archetype cards. Bedrock is almost entirely composed of shared/contested cards, which is excellent for draft interest but challenging for the drafter.

## Ranked List: Most On-Rails to Most Discovery-Oriented

| Rank | Archetype | Rails Score | Summary |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Crucible** (Stone+Ember) | 9/10 | Warrior lord = draft on autopilot. Almost zero decisions after pick 1. |
| 2 | **Basalt** (Zephyr+Stone) | 8/10 | Spirit Animal tribal is obvious, but materialize-matters bridge provides some fork. |
| 3 | **Gale** (Zephyr+Ember) | 7/10 | Musician fast-matters core is on-rails, but removal suite creates healthy ambiguity. |
| 4 | **Depths** (Tide+Stone) | 6/10 | Prevent accumulation gradually reveals archetype. Good pacing. |
| 5 | **Tempest** (Tide+Ember) | 5/10 | Event-copying signals storm, but generic energy/draw is ambiguous early. |
| 6 | **Cinder** (Ember+Ruin) | 5/10 | Abandon payoffs signal sacrifice, but Ember axis is shared with 2 other archetypes. |
| 7 | **Undertow** (Tide+Ruin) | 5/10 | Survivor tribal is narrow, but mill enablers and void-payoffs create gradual discovery. |
| 8 | **Mirage** (Tide+Zephyr) | 4/10 | Flicker enablers shared with Basalt; targets determine archetype. Great fork decisions. |
| 9 | **Eclipse** (Zephyr+Ruin) | 3/10 | Archetype emerges from combining two halves. Best emergent discovery. |
| 10 | **Bedrock** (Stone+Ruin) | 2/10 | Almost entirely contested cards. Archetype discovered, not opened. |

## Cards That Create Genuine Draft Tension (Multi-Archetype Demand)

### Tier 1: Format-Defining Contested Cards

These cards are wanted by 3+ archetypes for mechanically distinct reasons. They are the format's healthiest draft cards.

| Card | Archetypes | Why Each Wants It |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Architect of Memory** | Undertow, Eclipse, Bedrock | Undertow: void-size payoff. Eclipse: cycling Reclaim. Bedrock: mass reanimation. |
| **Path to Redemption** | Undertow, Eclipse, Bedrock | Same 3-way split on void recursion. |
| **Nexus Wayfinder** | Depths, Basalt, Bedrock, Crucible | Generic ramp wanted by all Stone-touching archetypes. |
| **Harvest the Forgotten** | Undertow, Bedrock, Tempest | Undertow: core mill. Bedrock: void setup. Tempest: cheap cantrip fuel. |
| **Keeper of Forgotten Light** | Depths, Mirage, Bedrock | Depths: control finisher. Mirage: flicker draw engine. Bedrock: reanimation target. |
| **Reclaimer of Lost Paths** | Undertow, Bedrock, Cinder | Undertow: Survivor recursion. Bedrock: Reclaim Revenant. Cinder: sacrifice loop. |

| **Ashmaze Guide** | Eclipse, Bedrock | Eclipse: discard-to-Reclaim engine. Bedrock: discard expensive cards for reanimation. |
| **Immolate** | Gale, generic Ember splash | Gale: core fast removal. Everyone else: premium removal. |
| **Whisper of the Past** | Tempest, Bedrock | Tempest: recover combo event. Bedrock: recover Entomb or Path to Redemption. |
| **Ashlight Caller** | Tempest, Undertow | Tempest: event recovery for storm. Undertow: Survivor body + event recursion. |
| **Moonlit Dancer** | Gale, Mirage | Gale: fast-matters engine. Mirage: instant-speed flicker from hand. |
| **Rebirth Ritualist** | Eclipse, Cinder | Eclipse: hand discard feeding void. Cinder: abandon trigger. |

### Tier 3: Broad-Demand Cards (Healthy Draft Staples)

| Card | Demand Profile |
|------|---------------|
| **Abolish** | Depths primary, any Tide deck splash. Universal high-pick. |
| **Epiphany Unfolded** | Tempest, Mirage, Depths, any deck. Legendary auto-pick. |
| **Arc Gate Opening** | Any deck wanting energy. Very broad demand. |
| **Guiding Light** | Any Tide deck. Tempest chain link, Undertow filter, generic cantrip. |
| **Scorched Reckoning** | Any Ember-touching deck as removal splash. |

## Worst "Only Goes Here" Offenders

These cards damage draft interest because they are so mechanically narrow that only a single archetype ever wants them. They function as auto-picks for one drafter and dead cards for the other 7.

### Most Severe Offenders (Cards That Actively Harm Draft)

| Card | Archetype | Why It Is a Problem |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Skyflame Commander** | Crucible | "Allied Warriors have +1 spark." Literally zero value outside Crucible. If you are not drafting Warriors, this is a blank card. |
| **Blade of Unity** | Crucible | "Spark = number of allied Warriors." Same problem. |
| **Company Commander** | Crucible | "When you materialize a Warrior, +1 spark." Same problem. |
| **Summons of the Bonded** | Crucible | "Discover a Warrior." Same problem. |
| **Spirit Bond** | Basalt | 12-energy event. "Each Spirit Animal gains spark = Spirit Animal count." Completely useless outside Basalt. |
| **Mystic Runefish** | Basalt | "3 energy: each Spirit Animal becomes 5 spark." Completely useless outside Basalt. |
| **Sage of the Prelude** | Gale | "When you play a fast card, draw 1." Does nothing in a deck without fast-matters density. |
| **Intermezzo Balladeer** | Gale | "When you play a fast card, +2 spark." Same problem. |
| **Melodist of the Finale** | Gale | "When you play a fast card, gain 1 point." Same problem. |
| **Sundown Surfer** | Gale | "When you play during opponent's turn, +1 spark." Nearly single-archetype. |

### Moderate Offenders (Narrow but Not Dead)

| Card | Archetype | Why It Is Narrow |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Seeker for the Way** | Crucible | Tutors Warriors specifically. Mild use as a generic 3-cost 2-spark body. |
| **Fury of the Clan** | Crucible | Removal scaled to Warrior count. Literal dead card without Warriors. |
| **Judgment of the Blade** | Crucible | Banishes non-Warriors. Most efficient in tribal, but technically usable everywhere. |
| **Spiritbound Alpha** | Basalt | "Pay 4: Spirit Animals gain +2 spark." Only meaningful with Spirit Animal density. |
| **Tideborne Voyager** | Mirage | "When ally banished, +1 spark." Only valuable with frequent banish effects. |
| **Soulkindler** | Undertow | "If in void, Survivors have +2 spark." Only meaningful with Survivor density. |
| **Keeper of the Tides** | Gale | "Discover a fast event." Narrow search criteria limits to fast-heavy decks. |
| **Echo Architect** | Tempest | Events cost 2 more, copy events. Only valuable in event-dense storm decks. |

## Structural Observations

### The Tribal Linearity Problem

The three tribal archetypes (Crucible/Warriors, Basalt/Spirit Animals, Undertow/Survivors) share a structural problem: tribal lords and tribal payoffs are inherently single-archetype cards. This is mitigated differently in each case:

- **Crucible** has the worst mitigation. Warriors are in Stone+Ember with very few bridges to other archetypes. The Warrior-sacrifice bridge to Cinder is the only escape hatch.
- **Basalt** has the best mitigation. The materialize-matters cluster creates a genuine bridge to Mirage, and Spirit Animal energy generators are useful ramp for any Stone deck.
- **Undertow** has moderate mitigation. Survivors appear in Cinder as sacrifice bodies, and the void-infrastructure is shared with Eclipse and Bedrock.

**Recommendation:** The format needs 2-3 more Warrior bodies that are mechanically useful outside of Crucible to reduce Crucible's extreme linearity. Warriors with abilities that appeal to non-Crucible archetypes (e.g., a Warrior with a discard trigger for Eclipse, or a Warrior with a Materialized draw effect for Mirage) would increase draft interest without diluting tribal density.

### The Enemy Pair Discovery Gradient

The five enemy pairs show a clear discovery gradient that is well-designed:
- **Tempest** (5/10) -- the most accessible enemy pair, with clear event-copying signals
- **Eclipse** (3/10) -- the emergent discovery pair
- **Bedrock** (2/10) -- the expert-level pair that rewards reading open lanes

This gradient means newer drafters can find Tempest (the most obvious enemy pair) while experienced drafters can exploit Eclipse and Bedrock (which require cross-category card reading). This is good design.

### The Shared Ruin Problem

Four archetypes share Ruin (Undertow, Cinder, Eclipse, Bedrock). The sub-theme differentiation (void-size-matters vs. Dissolved triggers vs. discard payoffs vs. reanimation) is well-designed on paper, but in practice, the 3-way contested cards (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) will create extreme draft variance. In pods where two Ruin drafters are fighting over these cards, one of them gets a functional archetype and the other gets a pile. The ramp backup plan for Bedrock and the cycling redundancy in Eclipse mitigate this somewhat, but Ruin oversubscription remains the format's primary draft health risk.

### The Neutral Card Pool

23 neutral cards provide important draft lubricant. Cards like Beacon of Tomorrow, Veil Shatter, Arc Gate Opening, and A New Adventure serve as flexible filler that any archetype can use without signaling anything. However, several "neutral" cards are actually soft Tempest signals (Arc Gate Opening as energy burst, Glimpse of Infinity as storm fuel). True neutrality is hard to achieve with mechanically meaningful cards.

### Overall Assessment

The format has a healthy range from on-rails (Crucible at 9/10) to discovery-oriented (Bedrock at 2/10). The primary concerns are:

1. **Crucible's extreme linearity** -- the format's worst offender for "draft on autopilot."
2. **Gale's narrow fast-matters core** -- 5 cards that are dead outside Gale, matching Crucible in absolute count.
3. **Basalt and Crucible together concentrating 10+ single-archetype tribal cards** -- a third of the format's "only goes here" offenders are Warrior or Spirit Animal lords.
4. **Bedrock's extreme fragility** -- the most interesting archetype to draft is also the one most likely to fail because its cards are all contested.

The strongest archetypes for draft interest are Mirage, Eclipse, Cinder, and Tempest -- each providing a satisfying blend of signal, discovery, and multi-archetype tension. These should serve as models for addressing the problems in the more linear archetypes.
