## 2. Ratings (1-10)

### Core Depth: 7/10

Eclipse's core mechanical identity is **self-discard for value**. The discard-payoff cards that directly reward discarding are:

**Dedicated discard-payoff cards (all in the accessible pool):**
- Voidthread Weaver (signpost) -- discard to grant event Reclaim; draw on void-event play
- Ridge Vortex Explorer -- discard this = materialize it (Zephyr)
- Apocalypse Vigilante -- discard: gain 1 point (Ruin)
- Mother of Flames -- discard: kindle 1 (Ruin)
- Ashmaze Guide -- discard: card gains Reclaim = cost (Ruin)
- Pattern Seeker -- Judgment: discard to draw + point (Ruin)
- Forgotten Titan -- costs 1 if discarded this turn (Ruin)
- Torchbearer of the Abyss -- once/turn discard: gain 1 energy, kindle 2 (Ruin)
- Duneveil Vanguard -- Judgment: discard to dissolve enemy (Ruin)
- Emberwatch Veteran -- pay 1, discard 1: kindle 2 (Ruin)
- Tidechannel Observer -- Judgment: 3+ void entries = 2 pts + kindle 1 (Ruin, NEW)

**Discard enablers (generate discards):**
- Evacuation Enforcer -- draw 2, discard 3 (Zephyr)
- Chronicle Reclaimer -- draw 1, discard 1 (Zephyr)
- Urban Cipher -- discard 2, draw 2 (Zephyr)
- Nocturne -- draw 1, discard 1 (Zephyr)
- Skies of Change -- discard 1, draw 2 (Zephyr)
- Fragments of Vision -- draw 3, discard 2 (Zephyr)
- Secrets of the Deep -- draw X, discard 2 (Zephyr)
- Wasteland Arbitrator -- each player discards 1 (Zephyr)
- A New Adventure -- draw 2, discard 2, gain 2 (Neutral)
- Moonlit Voyage -- draw 2, discard 2, Reclaim 2 (Neutral)

That is 11 dedicated payoffs and 10 enablers. This is a genuine engine -- you can construct a deck where every discard actively generates value through kindle, points, Reclaim, or materialization. This is significantly deeper than v1's "thin payoff layer."

The reason it is not an 8 or higher: almost all the payoffs are in Ruin. Zephyr contributes the enablers (the draw-then-discard cards) but almost no payoffs. This means Eclipse has a clear "engine half" (Ruin payoffs) and "fuel half" (Zephyr cycling), which is coherent but somewhat one-dimensional.

### Signpost Quality: 8/10

Voidthread Weaver is an excellent signpost. It does three things:
1. Creates a discard outlet (once per turn)
2. Converts that discard into event Reclaim from void
3. Rewards playing those reclaimed events with a draw

This is a complete engine on a single card. A drafter who picks Voidthread Weaver immediately understands: "I want to discard cards to recycle events, and I want Zephyr cycling cards to fuel the discard." The signal is unambiguous.

The only weakness is that it is event-Reclaim-focused (not character Reclaim), which narrows the build somewhat. But Ashmaze Guide covers the character side.

### Mechanical Coherence: 7/10

The discard theme creates a clean loop:
1. Draw extra cards (Zephyr cycling)
2. Discard for value (Ruin payoffs)
3. Reclaim discarded cards (Ruin recursion)
4. Repeat

All three phases of the loop are well-represented. The coherence loss comes from Ruin having a LOT of Survivor tribal and Undertow-focused cards (mill, Dissolved triggers) that are tangential to Eclipse's discard plan. About 15-18 of the 45 mono-Ruin cards are primarily Undertow/Bedrock-oriented and do not directly serve Eclipse. Similarly, 15+ Zephyr cards are purely Basalt-oriented (Spirit Animal tribal) or Mirage-oriented (flicker) with no discard connection.

The effective "on-theme" pool is roughly 35-45 cards out of 113 total, which is healthy -- it means Eclipse drafters must compete for overlapping cards but have enough depth to build a coherent deck.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 8/10

Eclipse sends very clean draft signals:
- Picking discard-payoff Ruin cards (Apocalypse Vigilante, Mother of Flames, Ashmaze Guide) signals Eclipse rather than Undertow or Bedrock, because those archetypes do not want discard payoffs
- Picking Zephyr cycling cards (Evacuation Enforcer, Chronicle Reclaimer, Skies of Change, Fragments of Vision) signals Eclipse rather than Gale or Mirage, because those archetypes prefer fast-play tempo or flicker
- The signpost (Voidthread Weaver) is dual Zephyr+Ruin, which unambiguously says Eclipse

There is modest signal collision with Cinder on cards like Forgotten Titan and Torchbearer of the Abyss, since Cinder (Ember+Ruin) also touches discard/void territory. But Cinder wants abandon payoffs, not draw-discard cycling, so the overlap is limited.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 6/10

Eclipse has moderate flexibility. The core plan (discard cycling + payoffs) is relatively focused. There are two meaningful sub-builds (see Section 4), but both revolve around the same discard axis. The archetype does not have the "multiple completely different strategies" diversity of, say, Tempest or Cinder.

The flex points are:
- How aggressively to lean into the void (Architect of Memory, Abomination of Memory)
- Whether to include Ruin recursion pieces (Reclaimer of Lost Paths, Ashlight Caller)
- How much Zephyr fast-play to include for tempo
- Whether to splash Moonlit Voyage / A New Adventure as neutral cycling

But the core skeleton is always: cycling enablers + discard payoffs.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Tidechannel Observer (Ruin, NEW) -- 3 cost, 1 spark, Ancient

"Judgment: If 3 or more cards entered your void this turn, gain 2 points and kindle 1."

This card is a quiet powerhouse in Eclipse. With even a single draw-discard cycle (Fragments of Vision discards 2, play another discard = 3+ void entries), the threshold is trivially met. In a deck that discards 3-5 cards per turn, this gives 2 points + kindle 1 every Judgment phase. That is a faster clock than most finishers. It also bridges to a splash of Ruin's Undertow cards (mill adds void entries) if the discard plan stalls.

### 2. Ridge Vortex Explorer (Zephyr) -- 3 cost, 2 spark, Explorer

"When you discard this, materialize it."

This is the card that turns Eclipse's discard engine from "value grinding" into "tempo explosion." Every draw-discard effect that hits this card effectively materializes a free 2-spark body. With Evacuation Enforcer (discard 3) or Urban Cipher (discard 2), there is a meaningful chance of hitting this card -- and once materialized, it becomes a 2-spark body that was free. Also combines with Ashmaze Guide: discard Ridge Vortex Explorer, it materializes AND gains Reclaim 3, so you can do it again. One of the few cards that converts Eclipse's cycling into board presence rather than just card advantage.

### 3. Wasteland Arbitrator (Zephyr) -- 1 cost, 1 spark, Fast Character, Survivor

"Materialized: Each player discards 1."

Cheap, fast, and immediately triggers every discard payoff you have in play. Mother of Flames kindles 1, Apocalypse Vigilante gains 1 point, Ashmaze Guide grants Reclaim. Plus the opponent discards too, providing disruption. At 1 cost and fast speed, it can be deployed reactively. The Survivor subtype even gives it marginal tribal synergy with Ruin's Survivor cards. Undervalued because "each player discards 1" looks symmetrical, but Eclipse turns it heavily asymmetrical.

---

## 4. Two Different Builds

### Build A: "Void Weaver" -- Discard-Reclaim Engine

**Strategy:** Use Zephyr cycling to churn through the deck, discarding cards for value, and Reclaim the best ones to replay them. This is the "engine" build that plays a long game.

**Core pieces:**
- Voidthread Weaver (signpost -- discard to Reclaim events, draw on void-event play)
- Ashmaze Guide (discard any card: it gains Reclaim = cost)
- Ashlight Caller (Materialized: event in void gains Reclaim = cost)
- Architect of Memory (void 7+: all cards have Reclaim = cost)
- Fragments of Vision, Skies of Change, Secrets of the Deep (cycling fuel)
- Nocturne (cycling + Reclaim 3 built in)
- Pattern Seeker, Apocalypse Vigilante (discard payoffs for points)
- Moonlit Voyage (neutral cycling + Reclaim 2)

**Win condition:** Incremental point generation from Pattern Seeker and Apocalypse Vigilante, plus spark from Forgotten Titan (costs 1 after discard) and Ridge Vortex Explorer (free materialize on discard). The Reclaim engine means key events keep coming back.

**Typical turn:** Play Fragments of Vision (draw 3, discard 2 -- Mother of Flames kindles 2, Ashmaze Guide grants Reclaim to both discards). Discard a card to Voidthread Weaver (event in void gains Reclaim). Play reclaimed event from void (draw 1 from Voidthread Weaver). The hand never runs dry.

### Build B: "Discard Aggro" -- Tempo Discard with Fast Plays

**Strategy:** Use cheap Zephyr fast bodies and aggressive discard payoffs to generate tempo and points quickly. Less recursion, more direct conversion of discards into board presence and damage.

**Core pieces:**
- Evacuation Enforcer (draw 2, discard 3 -- high-velocity fuel)
- Ridge Vortex Explorer (discard = free materialize)
- Mother of Flames (discard: kindle 1 -- fast clock)
- Torchbearer of the Abyss (once/turn discard: gain 1 energy, kindle 2)
- Duneveil Vanguard (discard: dissolve enemy spark 1 or less -- board control)
- Forgotten Titan (5/3 for 1 energy after a discard)
- Tidechannel Observer (2 pts + kindle per Judgment with 3+ void entries)
- Wasteland Arbitrator (fast, cheap, triggers all discard payoffs)
- Dreamtide Cartographer (3 or fewer in hand: draw 2 -- refuel after dumping hand)
- Windstride Runner (Gale signpost, accessible via Zephyr -- hellbent bonus if splashing)

**Win condition:** Kindle accumulation from Mother of Flames + Torchbearer of the Abyss + Tidechannel Observer generates fast points on leftmost character. Forgotten Titan provides an efficient body after any discard turn. Ridge Vortex Explorer gives free board presence.

**Typical turn:** Play Evacuation Enforcer (draw 2, discard 3 on Judgment -- Mother of Flames kindles 3, Tidechannel Observer triggers for 2 points + kindle 1). Deploy Forgotten Titan for 1 energy. End turn with 4 kindle generated and a 3-spark body materialized for 1 mana.

## 5. Problem Assessment: Is Eclipse Still "Thin Payoff Layer"?

### V1 Diagnosis Recap

In v1, Eclipse was flagged as having a "thin payoff layer" because:
- Discard payoffs were few (roughly 4-5 cards)
- The archetype lacked a dedicated signpost
- Zephyr's cycling cards existed but had no clear reason to be in Eclipse versus Gale or Mirage
- No event Reclaim engine to make the discard loop self-sustaining

### V2 Assessment: SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED

**What changed:**
1. **Voidthread Weaver** is a genuine signpost engine that ties discard-to-Reclaim-to-draw into a single card
2. **Tidechannel Observer** provides a void-velocity payoff that Eclipse can trigger trivially (3+ discards/turn)
3. **Ridge Vortex Explorer** moved from dual Zephyr+Ruin to mono-Zephyr, making it accessible without competing with dual-card scarcity -- and it is one of the most distinctive discard payoffs in the game
4. **Dreamtide Cartographer** (mono-Tide, but labeled primary archetype Eclipse) gives Eclipse a hand-size-matters draw engine that rewards the hellbent play pattern

**Remaining concerns:**

**CONCERN 1: Payoff concentration in Ruin.** Almost every discard payoff is in Ruin. If another drafter is on Undertow or Cinder and takes Ruin aggressively, Eclipse loses its payoffs while keeping its enablers -- a deck full of cycling with nothing to cycle into is just card-neutral card selection. This is the biggest structural risk. The mitigation is that Undertow and Cinder do not want the same Ruin cards (Undertow wants Survivor tribal and mill; Cinder wants abandon payoffs), so the discard-payoff cards are relatively Eclipse-specific.

**CONCERN 2: No discard-matters events.** All the payoffs are on characters (Mother of Flames, Apocalypse Vigilante, Ashmaze Guide, etc.). There are no events that say "when you discard, do X." This means the payoff engine takes time to set up (you need to materialize your payoff bodies before cycling). If those bodies get dissolved before you start cycling, the engine stalls. This is a legitimate vulnerability but is probably a feature rather than a bug -- it gives opponents meaningful counterplay.

**CONCERN 3: Dreamtide Cartographer is mono-Tide, not Zephyr or Ruin.** The allocation document lists Eclipse as one of its primary archetypes, but Eclipse drafters cannot access it through either of their resonances. This card requires a Tide splash or can only be accessed if Eclipse drafters happen to pick it up as an off-resonance speculative pick. This is a minor issue but worth noting -- Eclipse's hand-size-matters axis depends on a card they may struggle to draft.

**CONCERN 4: Limited removal.** Eclipse has access to neutral removal (Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration, Veil Shatter) and Duneveil Vanguard's conditional dissolve, but has no in-resonance unconditional removal spell. Ruin's Weight of Memory (dissolve cost < void count) helps but is void-volume-dependent. Zephyr has bounce (Abyssal Enforcer, Return to Nowhere) but no dissolve. This is manageable but means Eclipse must draft removal early from the neutral pool or rely on tempo plays.

### Verdict

Eclipse has moved from a **C- / D+** archetype in v1 to a solid **B / B+** in v2. The payoff layer is no longer thin -- there are 11 dedicated discard payoffs plus the signpost engine. The archetype has two viable builds, a clear draft identity, and enough depth to support 1-2 drafters at a table.

The remaining weaknesses (payoff concentration in Ruin, character-only payoffs, limited removal) are structural tensions that create interesting draft decisions rather than fatal flaws. Eclipse is no longer the archetype you fall into by accident when Undertow and Gale are contested -- it is a coherent strategy that rewards committed drafters.
