## 2. Health Ratings

### Core Depth: 8/10

Mirage's mechanical core -- cards that specifically reward or enable blink/flicker -- is impressively deep. The following cards form the dedicated flicker engine:

**Flicker enablers (cards that bounce/banish-and-return allies):**
- Flickerveil Adept (Judgment/Materialized: flicker ally spark 2 or less)
- Blooming Path Wanderer (Judgment: flicker ally)
- Dimensional Pathfinder (Judgment: pay 3 to flicker up to 2 allies)
- Starlight Guide (Materialized: banish ally, materialize it)
- Aurora Rider (Materialized: mass flicker)
- Portal of Twin Paths (event: banish up to 2 allies, materialize them)
- Passage Through Oblivion (banish ally, materialize at EOT)
- Nomad of Endless Paths (Materialized: bounce ally)
- Ethereal Courser (Stone, but accessible; Materialized: return ally to hand)
- Key to the Moment (return all but one ally to hand: draw per returned)
- Tideweaver Adept (modal: draw 2 or bounce ally + gain 2 energy)

**Materialized payoffs (premium flicker targets):**
- Frost Visionary (Materialized: draw 1)
- Tranquil Duelist (Materialized/Dissolved: draw 1)
- Looming Oracle (Materialized: draw 1)
- Aurora Channeler (Materialized: gain 3 energy)
- Keeper of Forgotten Light (Materialized: draw 2)
- Cosmic Puppeteer (Materialized: gain control of enemy cost 2 or less)
- Wraith of Twisting Shadows (Materialized: hand disruption)
- Tideborne Voyager (when ally banished, +1 spark)
- Astral Navigators (Materialized: foresee 2)
- Archivist of Vanished Names (Materialized: name type, dig for it)

**Zone-transition payoffs:**
- Starlit Cascade (ally leaves play: gain 2 energy)
- Ashen Threshold [Ember, cross-pollination] (ally leaves play: gain 1 energy)
- Nexus of Passing [Neutral] (spark = battlefield transitions, up to 8)
- The Bondweaver (when you materialize a character, +1 spark)

That is approximately 25 cards forming Mirage's mechanical core, spanning enablers, targets, and payoffs. This is an unusually deep core for a draft archetype.

**Score: 8/10** -- Extensive and layered. The only reason it is not a 9 or 10 is that some of the flicker enablers have tight spark restrictions (Flickerveil Adept caps at spark 2) or high costs (Aurora Rider at 6, Starlight Guide at 5), which limits how freely the engine runs in practice.

---

### Signpost Quality: 9/10

Tideweaver Adept is an exceptionally well-designed signpost card.

**Strengths:**
- **Modal design creates genuine decisions.** Draw-2 mode is good in any deck that cares about ETB value; bounce mode enables the flicker loop by returning an ally to hand while refunding 2 energy. A drafter picking this card immediately understands "I want Materialized creatures I can repeatedly re-enter."
- **Multi-archetype reach.** The bounce mode returns Spirit Animals for Basalt re-materialize triggers. The draw mode is generically strong for Depths control. The card does not lock you into a narrow build.
- **Appropriate power level.** At 4 cost (bumped up from 3 after balance review), the card is strong but not format-warping. Comparable to Keeper of Forgotten Light's draw-2 at 6 cost -- Tideweaver Adept at 4 is more efficient but requires the bounce mode to truly shine.
- **Clear signal.** Seeing this card early in a draft says "Mirage is open" without demanding you be in Mirage. A Basalt drafter would also take it.

**Minor weakness:** The Visitor subtype does not have strong tribal relevance to Mirage's game plan, so it functions purely on ability text rather than type synergies.

**Score: 9/10** -- One of the strongest signpost designs in the set.

---

### Mechanical Coherence: 9/10

Mirage has one of the most coherent game plans in the format: play creatures with Materialized abilities, then use flicker effects to re-trigger them, generating incremental value until your board is overwhelming.

**Why it scores so high:**
- **Clear cause-and-effect chain:** Flicker enabler -> triggers Materialized -> generates card/energy/spark advantage -> funds more flicker plays. This is a virtuous cycle that players can reason about intuitively.
- **Multiple value axes within the plan:** Flicker generates (a) cards via draw-on-Materialized, (b) energy via Aurora Channeler / Starlit Cascade / Ashen Threshold, (c) spark via The Bondweaver / Tideborne Voyager, and (d) board control via Cosmic Puppeteer / Wraith of Twisting Shadows. All feed the same engine.
- **Self-fueling economy:** Cards like Starlit Cascade (gain 2 energy when ally leaves), Aurora Channeler (gain 3 energy on Materialized), and Tideweaver Adept's bounce mode (gain 2 energy) ensure the flicker engine can sustain itself across turns without running out of mana.
- **Card advantage sustains hand size:** Frost Visionary, Tranquil Duelist, Looming Oracle, Keeper of Forgotten Light, and Celestial Reverie all draw cards when creatures enter play, preventing the engine from running out of fuel.

**Minor concern:** The archetype is almost entirely creature-based. Its event suite is thin (Portal of Twin Paths, Key to the Moment, Passage Through Oblivion, Starlit Cascade, Celestial Reverie, Call to the Unknown). This is not inherently a problem -- creature-based engines are a valid archetype -- but it means Mirage does not benefit much from Tempest's event-copying tools, creating a clean separation between the two Tide archetypes.

**Score: 9/10** -- Mechanically, this is one of the tightest archetypes in the set.

---

### Draft Signal Clarity: 7/10

Mirage's draft signals are clear but require some nuance:

**Clear signals (good):**
- Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer, Dimensional Pathfinder, Starlight Guide, and Aurora Rider are all essentially unplayable outside Mirage. Seeing them late is a very strong signal.
- Portal of Twin Paths, Key to the Moment, and Passage Through Oblivion are flicker-specific events that are nearly useless elsewhere.
- Call to the Unknown (discover character with Materialized) is an excellent early pick that signals "I want Materialized creatures" without committing to a specific color pair.

**Ambiguous signals (moderate concern):**
- Frost Visionary, Tranquil Duelist, and Looming Oracle are generically good Materialized creatures that any Tide or Zephyr archetype would play. They are staples rather than signals.
- Nomad of Endless Paths is good in both Mirage and Gale, so it does not narrow the signal.
- The Bondweaver and Lumin-Gate Seer serve Basalt equally well, creating signal confusion between Mirage and Basalt.

**Distinct from competing archetypes:**
- Mirage vs. Basalt: Mirage wants to repeatedly flicker the same creatures; Basalt wants to deploy many Spirit Animals and buff them. Flickerveil Adept (flicker ally spark 2 or less) is a Mirage signal; Spiritbound Alpha (Spirit Animals +2 spark) is a Basalt signal.
- Mirage vs. Depths: Depths wants Prevent effects and control tools; Mirage wants Materialized triggers. The overlap is in some high-cost Materialized creatures (Cosmic Puppeteer, Keeper of Forgotten Light).
- Mirage vs. Gale: Gale wants fast deployment and Musician tribal; Mirage wants repeated ETB triggers. Clear separation.

**Score: 7/10** -- The dedicated flicker cards are strong signals, but the strong overlap with Basalt (both care about materialize triggers) and the generically-strong Materialized creatures create some ambiguity in packs 1-2.

---

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 8/10

Mirage offers multiple meaningful build decisions:

**Key decision axes:**
1. **Flicker speed vs. flicker power:** Do you build a low-curve deck with cheap flicker targets (Frost Visionary, Tranquil Duelist, Looming Oracle) and cheap enablers (Passage Through Oblivion, Nomad of Endless Paths), or do you go for expensive high-impact flickers (Keeper of Forgotten Light, Cosmic Puppeteer, Aurora Rider)?
2. **Engine vs. value:** Do you invest in the self-sustaining flicker loop (Starlit Cascade + Aurora Channeler + flicker enablers) or do you play a midrange game with strong one-shot Materialized effects?
3. **Tide-lean vs. Zephyr-lean:** Tide gives access to card draw, Prevent as a fallback plan, and Celestial Reverie. Zephyr gives access to the dedicated flicker creatures, Moonlit Dancer (fast for characters), and some bounce effects.
4. **Figment integration:** Radiant Trio, Packcaller of Shadows, and Endless Projection provide 0-spark bodies that fuel The Bondweaver's spark growth, Tideborne Voyager's "ally banished" trigger (via flicker), and can be flickered for additional materialize triggers on other cards.
5. **Splash considerations:** Ashen Threshold (Ember) is a premium cross-pollination card for Mirage. Nexus of Passing (Neutral) provides an alternate finisher. Pyrestone Avatar (Stone) and Ethereal Courser (Stone) are valuable support pieces from the "wrong" resonance that a Mirage drafter might splash or pick up from neutral packs.

**Score: 8/10** -- The archetype supports meaningfully different configurations without being so open that it lacks identity.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Radiant Trio (Neutral, 3 energy, Event -- Materialize 3 figments)

At first glance, Radiant Trio is a mediocre card: 3 energy for three 0/0 figments that contribute no spark. In Mirage, it is secretly excellent. Three figments entering the battlefield triggers The Bondweaver three times (+3 spark), triggers Lumin-Gate Seer three times (draw 3 if they cost 0, which is 2 or less), and provides three bodies that can be flickered by Aurora Rider or Dimensional Pathfinder to re-trigger other Materialized abilities. Combined with Starlit Cascade, flickering/bouncing three figments generates 6 energy. The figments also serve as sacrifice fodder for Key to the Moment (return all but one ally to hand: draw per returned). In short, Radiant Trio is a hidden 3-energy "draw 3, gain 6 energy" in the right Mirage build.

### 2. Moonlit Dancer (Zephyr, 3 energy, 2 spark -- Characters in hand have fast; fast character: gain 1 energy)

Moonlit Dancer is tagged as Gale/Mirage but most drafters will associate it with the Gale Musician archetype. In Mirage, it is transformative. Giving all characters in hand "fast" means every flicker target you bounce to hand can be replayed at instant speed, turning Mirage from a sorcery-speed engine into a reactive one. This enables deploying Materialized creatures during the opponent's turn (triggering Cosmic Puppeteer's steal during combat, for example). The energy-on-fast-character rider partially offsets replay costs. Most critically, Moonlit Dancer turns Mirage's endgame from "play creatures and flicker during your turn" to "hold creatures in hand, deploy reactively, and generate value at instant speed" -- a fundamentally different play pattern that creates surprise potential.

### 3. Conduit of Resonance (Zephyr, 5 energy, 2 spark -- Materialize triggers Judgment abilities)

Tagged purely as Basalt, this card is extraordinarily powerful in Mirage. Every time you flicker a creature and re-materialize it, ALL allies' Judgment abilities trigger. This turns Flickerveil Adept into a recursive engine: flicker an ally, trigger all Judgment abilities (including Flickerveil Adept's own Judgment flicker), creating a chain of Judgment triggers. Combined with Ironveil Watcher (Stone, gain 1 point per other Judgment trigger up to 3) if splashed, or simply with Astral Navigators (Judgment: foresee), Blooming Path Wanderer (Judgment: flicker ally), and Dimensional Pathfinder (Judgment: pay 3 to flicker up to 2), each re-materialize cascades into multiple Judgment triggers that themselves trigger more flickers. Conduit of Resonance is the card that upgrades Mirage from "good value engine" to "potential combo deck."

---

## 4. Two Ways to Build Mirage

### Build A: "Tempo Flicker" (Zephyr-lean, low curve)

**Core:** Nomad of Endless Paths, Blooming Path Wanderer, Flickerveil Adept, Frost Visionary, Tranquil Duelist, Looming Oracle, Passage Through Oblivion, Starlit Cascade

**Game plan:** Play cheap Materialized creatures (2-3 cost) in the first 2-3 turns, drawing cards and building a small board. Begin flickering from turn 3-4 with Blooming Path Wanderer and Flickerveil Adept at Judgment, or with Passage Through Oblivion during the main phase. Starlit Cascade fuels the energy economy -- each flicker of a 2-cost creature generates 2 energy (ally leaves) and re-triggers a draw-1 ability. The deck aims to out-tempo the opponent through sustained card advantage and board presence, winning through accumulated spark on cheap bodies via The Bondweaver and Tideborne Voyager.

**Key cards:** Moonlit Dancer (fast deployment), Astral Navigators (fast body + Materialized value), Celestial Reverie (draw 1 per character played), Epiphany Unfolded (fast refuel).

**Curve:** Peaks at 2-3 cost. Wants 14-16 creatures, 6-8 events. Avoids expensive top-end.

**How it wins:** Incremental spark accumulation from Tideborne Voyager (+1 spark per banish) and The Bondweaver (+1 spark per materialize), supported by card advantage from repeated Materialized draws. Wins the long game through resource attrition rather than any single powerful finisher.

---

### Build B: "Engine Flicker" (Balanced Tide/Zephyr, higher curve)

**Core:** Aurora Rider, Keeper of Forgotten Light, Cosmic Puppeteer, Dimensional Pathfinder, Starlight Guide, Portal of Twin Paths, Aurora Channeler, Nexus of Passing

**Game plan:** Spend turns 1-4 deploying utility creatures and ramping energy (Aurora Channeler generates 3 energy on Materialized; Arc Gate Opening provides 4 energy). Turns 5-6, deploy the heavy hitters: Aurora Rider for mass flicker, Keeper of Forgotten Light for draw-2 on each re-entry, Cosmic Puppeteer for stealing enemies. Portal of Twin Paths and Dimensional Pathfinder provide repeatable flicker for the big bodies. Nexus of Passing serves as the finisher -- a single mass-flicker turn with Aurora Rider flickering 3 allies generates 6 battlefield transitions (3 leaves + 3 entries) = 6 spark on Nexus of Passing.

**Key cards:** Conduit of Resonance (materialize triggers all Judgment abilities -- cascading flickers), Call to the Unknown (discover character with Materialized -- finds the key piece), Archivist of Vanished Names (name Character to dig for the finisher).

**Curve:** Peaks at 4-5 cost. Wants 12-14 creatures, 8-10 events/removal. Includes ramp (Aurora Channeler, Arc Gate Opening, Glimpse of Infinity).

**How it wins:** A single explosive turn where Aurora Rider mass-flickers the board, Conduit of Resonance triggers all Judgment abilities (including Dimensional Pathfinder flickering more allies), and Nexus of Passing hits 6-8 spark. The explosive ceiling is much higher than Build A, but the deck is slower and more vulnerable to disruption in the early game.

---

## 5. Remaining Problems

### Problem 1: Removal Dependency on Neutral Pool (Moderate)

Mirage has essentially zero in-color removal. Tide's suite is almost entirely Prevent effects (reactive denial, not board removal). Zephyr has bounce (Abyssal Enforcer, Return to Nowhere, Break the Sequence) but no hard removal. Mirage must rely on the Neutral pool for actual dissolution effects (Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration, Veil Shatter). This means Mirage drafters will compete heavily with every other archetype for the same limited neutral removal, and may end up with decks that struggle to answer high-spark threats once they are on the board.

**Severity: Moderate.** Bounce effects (Abyssal Enforcer, Return to Nowhere) serve as pseudo-removal, and Cosmic Puppeteer's steal effect at 5 cost addresses some threats. But if an opponent deploys a 4+ spark character that bounce cannot efficiently answer, Mirage has limited options.

### Problem 2: Vulnerability to Pallid Arbiter (Moderate)

Pallid Arbiter (Tide, 2 cost, 2 spark) disables Materialized abilities of enemies. Ironically, this card is mono-Tide -- meaning it is in Mirage's own accessible pool. If an opponent plays Pallid Arbiter (a card any Tide archetype can run), Mirage's entire engine shuts down. None of Mirage's flicker targets generate value without their Materialized triggers. The archetype has no innate way to answer a 2-spark character on the opponent's board beyond bounce effects or neutral removal.

**Severity: Moderate.** This is a healthy counterplay dynamic rather than a design flaw -- every archetype should have answers. But Mirage drafters should be aware of the need to prioritize a copy of Scorched Reckoning, Veil Shatter, or Abyssal Enforcer to handle Pallid Arbiter.

### Problem 3: Spark Ceiling Concern Without Dedicated Finisher (Low-Moderate)

Mirage's individual creatures are low-spark (mostly 1-2 spark). The archetype generates points through volume (many creatures on board) and incremental kindle/spark growth (The Bondweaver, Tideborne Voyager). Without Nexus of Passing or a big finisher like Aurora Rider, Mirage can struggle to close games against archetypes that generate spark more efficiently (Crucible's Blade of Unity, Basalt's Spirit Bond, Cinder's Infernal Ascendant kindle stacking). The deck may draw many cards and have a full board but still lose on points.

**Severity: Low-Moderate.** Nexus of Passing (Neutral) and Aurora Rider (Zephyr, 3 spark + mass flicker) exist as finishers, but both are high-cost cards that Mirage must actively draft. If another drafter takes Nexus of Passing and Aurora Rider is not opened, the deck may lack a win condition.

### Problem 4: Anti-Synergy with Prevent Suite (Low)

Tide's Prevent events (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Infernal Rest, Echoing Denial, Cragfall, Together Against the Tide, Ripple Through Reality, Maelstrom Denial) are individually powerful but do not synergize with Mirage's game plan. They are reactive cards that do not advance the flicker engine. A Mirage drafter who takes too many Prevent effects ends up with a Depths-flavored control deck rather than a Mirage flicker deck. This is not a problem per se, but it means that roughly 10 of the 40 Tide cards are at best filler for Mirage.

**Severity: Low.** This is actually a healthy design feature -- it means Tide cards serve as shared resources between Mirage (wants Materialized triggers) and Depths (wants Prevent), preventing the two archetypes from competing for the exact same cards. A few Prevents (Abolish, Cragfall) are worth including as interaction, but the bulk should flow to Depths drafters.

### Problem 5: Figment Token Fragility (Low)

Several Mirage builds incorporate figments (via Radiant Trio, Packcaller of Shadows, Endless Projection) as cheap bodies to flicker and trigger materialize effects. However, figments have 0 spark, making them vulnerable to Burst of Obliteration (dissolve all characters with spark < X where X=1). A single Burst of Obliteration wipes all figments from the board. If the Mirage player has invested in figment-based value generation, this is a significant blowout.

**Severity: Low.** Figments are supplementary, not mandatory. Most Mirage builds function fine without them.

## Summary Scorecard

| Axis | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 8/10 | ~25 cards form the mechanical core, spanning enablers, targets, and payoffs |
| Signpost Quality | 9/10 | Tideweaver Adept is modal, multi-archetype, and clearly signals the plan |
| Mechanical Coherence | 9/10 | Flicker -> Materialized -> value is one of the tightest engines in the set |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 7/10 | Dedicated flicker cards are clear signals, but overlap with Basalt's materialize-matters creates ambiguity |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 8/10 | Tempo Flicker vs. Engine Flicker are genuinely distinct builds |
| **Overall** | **8.2/10** | **Mirage is one of the healthiest archetypes in the format** |

Mirage's greatest strength is its mechanical coherence -- the flicker engine is intuitive, self-sustaining, and generates multiple forms of advantage simultaneously. Its greatest vulnerability is the dependency on neutral removal and the potential for Pallid Arbiter to shut down the engine. The two-build structure (Tempo vs. Engine) ensures the archetype does not feel on-rails, and the hidden gems (Radiant Trio, Moonlit Dancer, Conduit of Resonance) reward deep format knowledge without being necessary for the archetype to function.
