# Tide Advocate Position Paper — V2 Design Council

## Overview

As the Tide advocate, I represent **Tempest** (Tide+Ember), **Mirage** (Tide+Zephyr), **Undertow** (Tide+Ruin), and **Depths** (Tide+Stone). Tide sits at 40 mono cards — the floor of the 38-45 range — which means every card assignment matters. My archetypes range from excellent (Mirage, Undertow, Tempest at A-/A-/A-) to the weakest of my four (Depths at B-/7.0). This paper outlines my assessment, concerns, and specific proposals.

## Archetype Assessments

### Tempest (Tide+Ember) — A- (8.2/10)

**Status: Healthy with one allocation error.**

Tempest is in excellent shape. The v2 changes successfully address the "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem from v1. Stormtide Oracle (cumulative void-event scaling) is a top-3 signpost design. The new "Slow Burn" build (reactive control with growing Oracle) is genuinely distinct from the classic "Big Storm" burst combo, providing real deckbuilding variety.

**Key strength:** Deepest event engine in the format (9/10 core depth). Redundant pieces at every role (fuel, amplify, payoff).

**Critical issue — Starcatcher contradiction:** The allocation document lists Starcatcher with "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" but assigns it to mono-Stone. Tempest (Tide+Ember) **cannot access Stone cards**. This is a genuine allocation error — Starcatcher's "when you play event, gain 1 energy" was one of Tempest's key energy-positive loop enablers. Losing it reduces the storm engine's self-sustaining capability. I understand Stone needed the card to address the deficit, but the archetype tag is actively misleading.

**Cards I want to keep in Tide:** Harvest the Forgotten (stealth storm card at 1-cost cantrip that mills for Oracle), Archivist of Vanished Names (non-homogeneous tutor engine), Duskwatch Vigil (Prevent-to-discount bridge), Dreamtide Cartographer (hand-empty refuel and spark mode).

**Cards I'm willing to negotiate on:** Oracle of Shifting Skies could theoretically serve other archetypes, but it's important Tempest infrastructure. Packcaller of Shadows is niche for Tempest's figment plan.

### Mirage (Tide+Zephyr) — A- (8.2/10)

**Status: Very healthy. One of the best-designed archetypes.**

Mirage has the tightest mechanical coherence in the format (9/10). The flicker -> Materialized -> value cycle is intuitive and self-sustaining. Tideweaver Adept is a top-tier signpost with its modal design creating genuine decisions. Two distinct builds (Tempo Flicker vs. Engine Flicker) prevent the archetype from feeling on-rails.

**Key strength:** ~25 cards forming the mechanical core spanning enablers, targets, and payoffs. The depth is exceptional for a draft archetype.

**Concerns:**
- Removal dependency on neutral pool (zero in-color hard removal)
- Pallid Arbiter is ironically in Mirage's own pool but shuts down the entire engine
- Spark ceiling without Nexus of Passing or Aurora Rider as finishers

**Cards I want to keep in Tide for Mirage:** Call to the Unknown (discover Materialized character), Portal of Twin Paths (key flicker event), Celestial Reverie (draw-on-character-play for flicker chains), Starlit Cascade (energy from ally-leaves-play).

### Undertow (Tide+Ruin) — A- (8.2/10)

**Status: Strong and mechanically cohesive.**

Undertow has one of the deepest cores in the format (9/10). The self-mill -> void exploitation -> Survivor recursion loop is exceptionally well-integrated. Abyssal Reclaimer's conditional retrieval ("other-source void entry") is elegant — it's easy to meet in-archetype but genuinely conditional. Tidechannel Observer adds a brilliant new void-velocity scoring axis that cleanly differentiates Undertow (trivially hits 3 entries/turn) from Bedrock (almost never hits 3).

**Key strength:** Multiple redundant mill sources, void payoffs at every cost point, and deep Survivor tribal density (20 Survivors accessible).

**Concerns:**
- Over-reliance on Soulkindler as the sole passive void-based anthem
- Void-banish vulnerability (Soulflame Predator is catastrophic)
- Ruin shared by 4 archetypes creates draft signal noise

**Cards I want to keep in Tide for Undertow:** Harvest the Forgotten (core mill+draw), Reunion (void retrieval), Guiding Light (foresee+draw+reclaim trifecta), Archivist of Vanished Names (tutor+incidental mill).

### Depths (Tide+Stone) — B- (7.0/10)

**Status: Functional but weakest of my four. Needs more help.**

Depths was the worst archetype in v1 (C+) and has improved to B-, but it remains the format's second-weakest archetype (only Bedrock at 6.8 is lower). Watcher of the Fathoms resolves the critical signpost problem and creates a unique play pattern, but the structural issues run deeper than a single signpost can fix.

**Core problems:**
1. **Stone pool dilution is severe.** Of Stone's 40 cards, roughly 18-20 are Warrior or Spirit Animal tribal with zero Depths synergy. The effective Stone pool for Depths is closer to 20 cards.
2. **Lowest accessible pool at 105.** Every other archetype has 108-115.
3. **Draft signal clarity is weakest (6/10).** Hard to distinguish "Stone is open" from "Crucible/Basalt aren't being drafted."
4. **No event-based removal in mono-Tide or mono-Stone.** Entirely dependent on neutral pool for dissolve effects.
5. **Win condition speed.** Kindle accumulation is inherently slow vs. fast archetypes.
6. **New Stone cards overlap with Crucible.** Everhold Protector, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden — all tagged for both Crucible and Depths. Crucible will snap these up first.

**What Depths needs beyond its single signpost:**
- 1-2 more Stone cards that are Depths-primary (not shared with Crucible)
- A Depths-exclusive finisher or payoff that doesn't require tribal density
- Better card advantage from the Stone half (currently only The Waking Titan at Judgment: draw 1)

## The Starcatcher Contradiction — My Central Grievance

This is the single most important issue I'm raising at this council.

**Facts:**
- Starcatcher was Ember in v1. Tempest (Tide+Ember) could access it.
- Starcatcher was moved to Stone to address the Stone deficit.
- The allocation document still lists "Primary Archetype(s): Tempest, Basalt" for Starcatcher.
- Tempest CANNOT access Stone cards.
- This is acknowledged as an error in both the Tempest health check and integration review.

**My position:** I understand Stone needed cards. I'm not asking to move Starcatcher back to Ember (that would undo the Stone deficit fix). But either:

1. **Remove "Tempest" from Starcatcher's archetype tags** (acknowledge the loss), OR
2. **Create a replacement effect in Ember** — a new mono-Ember card that provides event-triggered energy generation for Tempest. Something like "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" on a 3-cost body would fill the exact gap Starcatcher left.

Option 2 is better design. Option 1 is lower effort but Tempest absorbs a real loss.

Ember is at 45 (ceiling), so Option 2 requires either cutting an Ember card or raising the ceiling. I'll discuss this directly with the Ember advocate.

## The Dreamtide Cartographer Dilemma

The integration review recommends moving Dreamtide Cartographer from mono-Tide to mono-Zephyr to fix Gale's accessibility gap (3 cards designed for Gale are inaccessible).

**My analysis of this trade:**

Moving Cartographer to Zephyr would:
- **GAIN:** Give Gale, Eclipse, Basalt, and Mirage access (all Zephyr archetypes)
- **LOSE:** Remove Tempest, Undertow, and Depths access (Tide-only archetypes)

For my archetypes:
- **Tempest:** Loses a supplementary card but has 9/10 core depth. Absorbable.
- **Undertow:** Loses a marginal inclusion. Undertow doesn't specifically need it.
- **Depths:** This is the painful one. Dreamtide Cartographer is secretly one of Depths's best cards — in a deck that holds a full hand, it almost always fires the spark mode (+1 spark to all allies per Judgment). Depths is already the weakest archetype. Taking away a hidden gem from it hurts.

**My position:** I'm willing to let Dreamtide Cartographer move to Zephyr IF Depths receives compensation. This could be:
- A new Stone or Tide card that provides a similar board-wide spark pump for control decks
- Starcatcher being re-tagged as a Depths card (it's already in Stone, and "when you play event, gain 1 energy" is useful for Depths's event-heavy control plan)

I'll propose this trade to the Zephyr advocate.

## Specific Trade Proposals

### To the Ember Advocate:
1. **The Starcatcher replacement:** I need event-triggered energy in Ember for Tempest. Either a new card or a modification to an existing one. In exchange, I'll support any reasonable Ember requests regarding shared cards.
2. **Data Pulse moved to Ember is fine.** The move is mechanically correct (energy generation = Ember). Tempest still accesses it via its Ember half. No complaint.
3. **Ashen Threshold is excellent.** As cross-pollination for Mirage, this is a hidden gem. I want to keep this in Ember — no changes needed.

### To the Zephyr Advocate:
1. **Dreamtide Cartographer move:** I can accept this if Depths gets compensation (see above).
2. **Aurora Rider staying mono-Zephyr is fine.** Mirage accesses it through Zephyr. The mass-flicker ability is quintessential Zephyr motion.
3. **Gale's accessibility problem:** I acknowledge that Duskwatch Vigil (mono-Tide) was designed for Gale but Gale can't draft it. I'm open to cleaning up the archetype tags — remove Gale from Duskwatch Vigil's tags since it's a Depths/Tempest card that Gale simply can't access.

### To the Stone Advocate:
1. **Depths needs more dedicated Stone support.** The 7 new Stone cards mostly serve Crucible and Basalt. Only Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden have Depths as a listed archetype, and both are shared with Crucible. I'd like at least one Stone card where Depths is the PRIMARY beneficiary.
2. **Starcatcher re-tagging:** If Starcatcher stays in Stone, please either remove "Tempest" from its tags (honesty) or re-tag it as "Depths, Basalt" instead (Depths CAN access it and the event-energy ability is useful for Depths's event-heavy control plan).
3. **Pallid Arbiter moved to Tide is correct.** "Disable enemy Materialized" is reactive denial = Tide identity. This card is great for Depths. Thank you for the trade.

### To the Ruin Advocate:
1. **Undertow's Survivor cards:** The mono-Ruin Survivors that moved from duals (Searcher in the Mists, Flagbearer of Decay) are critical for Undertow. Please don't reassign them.
2. **Voidthorn Protector is excellent.** A Prevent in Ruin is unconventional but the self-sacrifice cost justifies it. Great bridge between Depths and Undertow. Remove Gale from its tags though — Gale can't access mono-Ruin.
3. **Tidechannel Observer is brilliant.** Void-velocity scoring cleanly differentiates Undertow from Bedrock. Keep as-is.
4. **Risen Champion:** The Warrior-in-Ruin is a deliberate cross-resonance signal for Crucible-Bedrock bridge. Fine by me — it doesn't compete with Undertow's Survivor focus.

## Cards I Want to Keep Unchanged

These Tide cards are correctly assigned and working well:

| Card | Why It Must Stay |
|------|-----------------|
| Harvest the Forgotten | Core for both Tempest (storm cantrip) and Undertow (mill+draw) |
| Archivist of Vanished Names | Best-designed new card, praised by all audits |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Depths's key Prevent payoff, Tempest's storm insurance |
| Reunion | Undertow's void retrieval + Bedrock bridge |
| Starlit Cascade | Mirage's energy-from-flicker economy |
| Call to the Unknown | Mirage's tutor for flicker targets |
| Pallid Arbiter | Depths's tech piece (moved FROM Stone correctly) |
| Epiphany Unfolded | Tempest/Mirage draw ceiling |
| Guiding Light | Undertow's triple-mode utility spell |

---

## Summary of Priorities

1. **CRITICAL:** Resolve the Starcatcher contradiction (either fix tags or create Ember replacement)
2. **HIGH:** Shore up Depths with 1-2 more Depths-primary Stone cards
3. **MEDIUM:** Negotiate the Dreamtide Cartographer move with compensation for Depths
4. **MEDIUM:** Clean up archetype tags on cards designed for archetypes that can't access them (Gale on Duskwatch Vigil, Gale on Voidthorn Protector, Eclipse on Dreamtide Cartographer)
5. **LOW:** Monitor Undertow's Soulkindler dependency and void-banish vulnerability

The Tide resonance is generally well-served by v2. Three of my four archetypes are A-tier. The urgent work is bringing Depths from B- closer to B+ and fixing the Starcatcher allocation error.
