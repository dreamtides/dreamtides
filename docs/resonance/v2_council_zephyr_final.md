# Zephyr Advocate -- Final Revised Archetype Assessments

## Council Round 10 -- Post-Discussion Summary

This document reflects my final position after sending proposals to all 4 advocates and analyzing the full v2 allocation, 25 new card designs, 222 existing cards, all 4 Zephyr-archetype health checks, and the integration review.

---

## Overall Zephyr Resonance Health

**Zephyr mono count: 43 cards** (2nd highest, within 38-45 target)

Zephyr's 43 cards divide cleanly across its 4 archetypes with minimal cannibalization:
- ~12-14 Spirit Animal tribal cards (Basalt-specific)
- ~7-8 fast-matters cards (Gale-oriented)
- ~8-10 flicker cards (Mirage-oriented)
- ~6-7 discard cycling cards (Eclipse-oriented)
- ~5-6 generically useful cards

This distribution is well-balanced. Each Zephyr archetype has a clear "home" within the pool. The primary tension is that Zephyr's large pool includes many cards that individual archetypes can't use (Gale can't use Spirit Animals; Basalt can't use discard cycling), which means effective on-plan pools are smaller than raw accessible pools suggest.

---

## Archetype 1: Mirage (Tide+Zephyr) -- FINAL GRADE: A- (8.2/10)

### Status: HEALTHY -- No Changes Needed

Mirage is the healthiest of my 4 archetypes and one of the strongest in the entire format. The flicker engine is mechanically coherent (9/10), deeply supported (~25 core cards), and offers two genuinely distinct builds.

**Strengths:**
- **Tideweaver Adept** is a top-3 signpost (9/10) -- modal design creates real decisions
- **~25-card mechanical core** spanning flicker enablers (Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer, Dimensional Pathfinder, Starlight Guide, Aurora Rider, Portal of Twin Paths), premium targets (Frost Visionary, Keeper of Forgotten Light, Cosmic Puppeteer, Archivist of Vanished Names), and zone-transition payoffs (Starlit Cascade, The Bondweaver, Tideborne Voyager)
- **Two distinct builds**: Tempo Flicker (low curve, incremental advantage) vs. Engine Flicker (high curve, explosive Conduit of Resonance combos)
- **Self-fueling economy**: Aurora Channeler, Starlit Cascade, Tideweaver Adept's bounce mode all generate energy to sustain the flicker loop

**Known Vulnerabilities (acceptable):**
- Removal dependency on neutral pool (no in-color hard removal)
- Pallid Arbiter (Tide, 2 cost) disables Materialized abilities -- the primary counter-card
- Spark ceiling without Nexus of Passing or Aurora Rider as finisher

**Hidden Gems I Want to Highlight:**
1. **Radiant Trio** (Neutral) -- secretly "draw 3, gain 6 energy" when combined with Lumin-Gate Seer + Starlit Cascade
2. **Moonlit Dancer** (Zephyr) -- transforms Mirage from sorcery-speed to reactive-speed engine
3. **Conduit of Resonance** (Zephyr) -- upgrades Mirage from value engine to combo deck

**Assessment:** No changes recommended. Mirage's vulnerabilities are healthy counterplay dynamics. The archetype rewards skilled play and deep format knowledge without being dominant.

## Archetype 2: Gale (Zephyr+Ember) -- FINAL GRADE: B (7.2/10) -- REVISED: B+ (7.6/10) with Three-Way Trade

### Status: NEEDS TARGETED HELP -- 1 High-Priority Fix (Consensus Reached)

Gale is my most underserved archetype. Despite a 113-card accessible pool, the effective on-plan pool is ~70-76 cards due to Basalt Spirit Animal bloat in Zephyr and Tempest/Crucible/Cinder cards in Ember that are off-plan.

**Critical Issue: Accessibility Gap**

Three cards designed for Gale are inaccessible:
| Card | Resonance | Why Inaccessible |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Dreamtide Cartographer | Mono-Tide | Gale is Zephyr+Ember |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Mono-Tide | Gale is Zephyr+Ember |
| Voidthorn Protector | Mono-Ruin | Gale is Zephyr+Ember |

Gale received only 3 directly accessible new cards (Windstride Runner, Ashen Threshold, Nexus of Passing) -- the fewest of any archetype. Only 1 (Windstride Runner) was specifically designed for Gale.

**Primary Proposal: Move Dreamtide Cartographer from Mono-Tide to Mono-Zephyr**
- Hand-emptying draw mode ("3 or fewer in hand: draw 2") is Zephyr-coded
- Fixes accessibility for both Gale and Eclipse simultaneously
- Tempest (9/10 core depth) can absorb the loss
- Zephyr goes 43→44, Tide goes 40→39 -- both within target range

**Secondary Proposals:**
- Remove "Gale" from Duskwatch Vigil and Voidthorn Protector archetype tags (cleanup)
- Consider a future mono-Ember fast-matters card for cross-resonance payoff redundancy (Musician package at only 4 cards is a concentration risk)

**Strengths:**
- Deepest fast-card density in the format (~20+ fast cards)
- Clear mechanical identity (fast-matters + Musician tribal)
- Windstride Runner signpost is solid (7/10) -- hellbent + abandon-0-spark draw
- Draft signals are clean (8/10) -- fast keyword + Musicians are crisp

**Weaknesses:**
- Deckbuilding flexibility: 6/10 -- linear "is this card fast?" filter
- Musician subtype concentration: only 4 cards (Sage, Intermezzo, Melodist, Minstrel)
- Build B ("Scorched Earth") overlaps heavily with Cinder's sacrifice plan -- 6 of 12 core Ember cards are Cinder-contested
- No Prevent access without splash

**If Three-Way Trade Goes Through (Cartographer to Zephyr + Smolder Sprite in Ember):**
- Gale gains a hand-emptying draw engine that refuels after fast-play dumps
- Smolder Sprite (1-cost Ember Survivor, "Materialized: Materialize a figment. Abandon: Kindle 1") gives Gale a cheap fast body + figment for Windstride Runner's 0-spark abandon target
- Build A (Musician Crescendo) becomes deeper and more resilient
- Grade improves from B (7.2) to B+ (7.6) -- Smolder Sprite is slightly better than Cartographer alone because it directly serves the fast-tempo plan

**Hidden Gems:**
1. **Wasteland Arbitrator** (Zephyr, 1 cost) -- cheapest fast body, triggers Musicians, asymmetric discard
2. **Ashen Threshold** (Ember NEW) -- "ally leaves play: gain 1 energy" triggers off bounced fast bodies
3. **Aspiring Guardian** (Neutral, 0 cost) -- free fast body with Moonlit Dancer; 0-spark Windstride Runner abandon target

---

## Archetype 3: Basalt (Zephyr+Stone) -- FINAL GRADE: B+ (7.8/10)

### Status: STRONG BUT MONITOR AUTO-BUILD

Basalt is mechanically excellent with one persistent design concern: auto-build convergence.

**What's Working:**
- **9/10 Core Depth**: 33+ on-plan cards across both resonances (16 from Zephyr, 16 from Stone, signpost)
- **9/10 Mechanical Coherence**: Deploy cheap SAs → Judgment triggers generate energy → activated abilities convert energy to spark → finishers scale with board width
- **Spirit Animal tribal** is the cleanest tribal package in the format (17/19 SAs in Zephyr+Stone)
- **Stoneveil Guardian** signpost is functional (7/10) with genuine mode-switching
- **Two builds**: Spirit Engine (go-wide aggro) vs. Judgment Storm (Conduit combo)

**The Auto-Build Problem (Deckbuilding Flexibility: 6/10):**

With 33+ on-plan cards for ~25-card decks, most Basalt decks converge toward a similar core. The v2 non-SA Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit) create "dilute tribal for power" decisions, but the core tribal package is so deep that marginal decisions are mostly within-tribe card ordering.

The 4 new Stone cards that are Basalt-viable (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit, Everhold Protector/Ironbark Warden conditionally) actually push the on-plan pool from 33 to ~37, slightly exacerbating the problem.

**My Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. If Basalt decks prove too homogeneous, consider:
1. Converting 1-2 Spirit Animals to different subtypes (e.g., Emerald Guardian → Ancient, since its "Judgment: Gain 2 energy" doesn't require SA tribal)
2. This reduces SA density without weakening the individual cards, creating more genuine draft decisions

**Anti-Synergy Design (Good):**
- Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden ("since last turn" checks) create intentional tension with Zephyr flicker
- Basalt's "stay and fight" identity is correctly separated from Mirage's "blink and re-enter" identity
- First-time drafter traps exist but are educational rather than punishing

**Mass Removal Fragility:**
- SA bodies at 1 spark are trivially wiped by Burst of Obliteration paying 2 energy
- No protection against mass dissolve in the accessible pool
- Compensated by fast reload speed (cheap SAs replenish quickly if hand is intact)

**Starcatcher Support:** I actively support Starcatcher staying in Stone (moved from Ember in v2). Its "when you play event, gain 1 energy" as persistent ramp fits Stone's permanence identity and benefits Basalt's energy infrastructure. The contradiction with its "Tempest" archetype tag should be resolved by removing Tempest from the tag.

**Hidden Gems:**
1. **Boundless Wanderer** (Neutral, 2 cost, all types) -- counts as SA for every tribal payoff
2. **Surge of Fury** (Stone, 1 cost) -- double Judgment phase is devastating with 4+ Judgment bodies
3. **Vanguard of the Summit** (Stone NEW) -- Basalt hits "3rd character this turn" more reliably than Crucible

## Archetype 4: Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) -- FINAL GRADE: B (7.2/10) -- REVISED: B (7.4/10) if Dreamtide Cartographer Moves

### Status: SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED FROM V1 -- Minor Ongoing Fragility

Eclipse has improved from v1's C-/D+ to a genuine B-tier archetype. The "thin payoff layer" problem is resolved -- 11 dedicated discard payoffs + Voidthread Weaver engine form a coherent strategy.

**What Changed from V1:**
1. Voidthread Weaver provides the discard-to-Reclaim-to-draw engine Eclipse was missing
2. Tidechannel Observer provides void-velocity scoring (3+ void entries → 2 pts + kindle 1)
3. Ridge Vortex Explorer (discard = free materialize) creates a distinctive payoff unique to Eclipse
4. The 11 payoff cards + 10 enablers form a genuine engine with clear draft signals

**Remaining Concerns:**

1. **Payoff concentration in Ruin.** Almost all discard payoffs are Ruin cards. However, my analysis shows Eclipse has 6-7 "Eclipse-exclusive" Ruin cards (Apocalypse Vigilante, Mother of Flames, Pattern Seeker, Ashmaze Guide, Duneveil Vanguard, and arguably Forgotten Titan) that other Ruin archetypes don't want. This differentiation is better than I initially feared.

2. **Dreamtide Cartographer inaccessibility.** Listed as Eclipse primary archetype but Eclipse can't access mono-Tide. The proposed move to Zephyr fixes this.

3. **Character-only payoffs.** All discard payoffs are on creatures, making the engine vulnerable to dissolve effects. This is probably intentional (gives opponents meaningful counterplay) but creates fragility.

4. **Limited removal.** Eclipse has access to Duneveil Vanguard (conditional dissolve), neutral removal, Zephyr bounce, and Ruin's Weight of Memory (void-volume-dependent). No unconditional in-resonance removal.

5. **Deckbuilding flexibility: 6/10.** Two builds (Void Weaver engine vs. Discard Aggro tempo) but both on the same discard axis. Less strategic diversity than higher-rated archetypes.

**Voidthread Weaver (Signpost, 8/10):**
- Complete engine on one card: discard outlet → event Reclaim → draw on void-event play
- Clear, unambiguous draft signal
- Only weakness: event-Reclaim-focused (not character), narrowing the build somewhat

**Eclipse's Exclusive Ruin Cards (Well-Differentiated):**
| Card | Mechanic | Eclipse-Exclusive? |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Apocalypse Vigilante | Discard: gain 1 point | Yes |
| Mother of Flames | Discard: kindle 1 | Yes |
| Pattern Seeker | Judgment: discard to draw+point | Yes |
| Ashmaze Guide | Discard: gains Reclaim = cost | Yes |
| Duneveil Vanguard | Discard to dissolve | Yes |
| Forgotten Titan | Costs 1 if discarded | Mostly (Cinder fringe) |
| Torchbearer of the Abyss | Once/turn discard: energy + kindle | Shared with Cinder |
| Emberwatch Veteran | Pay 1, discard: kindle 2 | Shared with Cinder |

**Assessment:** Eclipse is healthy at B-tier. The Dreamtide Cartographer move would improve it marginally (hand-emptying draw engine rewards the discard-heavy play pattern). The main risk is Cinder competing for Torchbearer and Emberwatch Veteran, but Eclipse has enough exclusive payoffs to survive this competition.

**Hidden Gems:**
1. **Tidechannel Observer** (Ruin NEW) -- 2 pts + kindle per Judgment with trivially-met 3+ void entries
2. **Ridge Vortex Explorer** (Zephyr) -- free materialize on discard; transforms cycling into board presence
3. **Wasteland Arbitrator** (Zephyr, 1 cost) -- cheap, fast, triggers all discard payoffs while disrupting opponent

## Summary of Proposed Changes

### High Priority
1. **Move Dreamtide Cartographer from mono-Tide to mono-Zephyr** -- fixes Gale and Eclipse accessibility, highest-impact single change
2. **Clean up inaccessible archetype tags:**
   - Remove "Gale" from Duskwatch Vigil
   - Remove "Gale" from Voidthorn Protector
   - Remove "Basalt" and "Mirage" from Shadowpaw
   - Remove "Bedrock" from Ashen Threshold
   - Remove "Tempest" from Starcatcher

### Medium Priority
3. **Support Starcatcher staying in Stone** -- benefits Basalt, Tempest absorbs the loss

### Low Priority (Future Rounds)
4. Consider a mono-Ember fast-matters card for Gale cross-resonance redundancy
5. Monitor Basalt auto-build in playtesting; consider SA subtype conversions if needed
6. Consider Stone/Ruin events in future batches (all 25 new cards are characters)

### No Changes Needed
- **Mirage**: Healthy at A- (8.2/10)
- **Basalt core design**: Strong at B+ (7.8/10)
- **Eclipse engine design**: Functional at B (7.2/10)
- **All existing Zephyr card assignments**: Well-balanced across archetypes

## Final Archetype Rankings (Zephyr Perspective)

| Rank | Archetype | Grade | Status | Key Metric |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Mirage | A- (8.2) | Healthy | 9/10 coherence, 9/10 signpost |
| 2 | Basalt | B+ (7.8) | Monitor | 9/10 depth, 6/10 flexibility |
| 3 | Eclipse | B (7.2→7.4*) | Improved | 8/10 signpost, 6/10 flexibility |
| 4 | Gale | B (7.2→7.6*) | Needs help | 8/10 signals, 6/10 flexibility |

*Revised grades conditional on Three-Way Trade (Cartographer to Zephyr + Data Pulse to Tide + Smolder Sprite in Ember).

**Post-Discussion Update:** The council has reached strong consensus on the Three-Way Trade proposed by the Ember advocate and endorsed by Stone, Zephyr, and Ruin. Tide has conditionally accepted pending Starcatcher re-tag (also consensus). This package resolves the #1 outstanding issue (Gale/Eclipse accessibility) while maintaining all resonance counts within the 38-45 range. The Zephyr resonance is fundamentally healthy. The remaining concerns (Basalt auto-build, Musician concentration, Eclipse Ruin-dependency) are structural features that create draft tension rather than design failures, and should be monitored in playtesting rather than pre-emptively changed.
