# V2 Revised Master Allocation

## Methodology

Starting from the v1 final allocation (Round 7), this revision:

1. **Removes all 18 v1 new cards** (cards #223-240 in v1 allocation).
2. **Adds 25 v2 new cards** with resonance assignments per v2_new_cards_final.md.
3. **Restricts dual-resonance to exactly 10 cards** -- the 10 v2 dual signpost cards (one per archetype pair). All 13 existing dual cards from v1 revert to mono-resonance.
4. **Addresses Stone mono deficit** by shifting additional cards to Stone where mechanically justified.
5. **Fixes mechanically strained assignments** flagged in the QA report (Cloaked Sentinel, Data Pulse, Pallid Arbiter).
6. **Re-evaluates neutral pool** for appropriate size and membership.

**Total card count: 222 existing + 25 new = 247 cards.**

### Existing Cards Changed from Dual to Mono (13 cards)

These cards were dual-resonance in v1 but are now mono, since the only duals are the 10 v2 signpost cards.

| Card Name | V1 Resonance | V2 Resonance | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Aurora Rider | Tide+Zephyr | Zephyr | Mass-flicker Materialized ability is quintessential Zephyr motion. Mirage accesses via Zephyr half. |
| Harvest the Forgotten | Tide+Ruin | Tide | Mill + draw is Tide's information identity. Undertow accesses via Tide. |
| Searcher in the Mists | Tide+Ruin | Ruin | Mill-on-materialize and mill-on-dissolved are Ruin's void-filling identity. Undertow accesses via Ruin. |
| Flagbearer of Decay | Tide+Ruin | Ruin | "Play Survivor: mill 2" is Ruin Survivor tribal feeding the void. Undertow accesses via Ruin. |
| Conduit of Resonance | Zephyr+Stone | Zephyr | "Materialize triggers Judgment abilities" -- the primary action is Zephyr's materialize trigger. Basalt accesses via Zephyr. |
| Blazing Emberwing | Zephyr+Stone | Zephyr | "Judgment triggers on materialize" -- Spirit Animal tribal + materialize trigger = Zephyr. Basalt accesses via Zephyr. |
| Ridge Vortex Explorer | Zephyr+Ruin | Zephyr | "When you discard this, materialize it." Discard-to-materialize creates cross-zone motion -- Zephyr's motion identity. Eclipse accesses via Zephyr. |
| Surge of Fury | Stone+Ember | Stone | "Trigger additional Judgment phase." Judgment is Stone's mechanical domain. Crucible accesses via Stone. |
| Revenant of the Lost | Stone+Ruin | Ruin | "May only play from void." Void-only play is Ruin's core mechanic. Bedrock accesses via Ruin. |
| Titan of Forgotten Echoes | Stone+Ruin | Ruin | "Play N cards: Reclaim." Reclaim is Ruin's core mechanic. Bedrock accesses via Ruin. |
| Exiles of the Last Light | Ember+Ruin | Ember | "Abandon ally: Kindle 1." Abandon payoff = Ember sacrifice identity. Cinder accesses via Ember. |
| Eclipse Herald | Ember+Ruin | Ember | "Banish 3 from void to dissolve enemy." Primary effect is dissolve (Ember removal identity). Void-banish cost is secondary. Cinder accesses via Ember. |
| Rebirth Ritualist | Ember+Ruin | Ember | "Abandon character, discard hand: Draw 3." Abandon sacrifice = Ember. Cinder accesses via Ember. |

### Existing Cards Changed Resonance (mono-to-mono shifts, 5 cards)

| Card Name | V1 Resonance | V2 Resonance | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Cloaked Sentinel | Tide | Stone | QA flagged as mechanically strained. "Opponent's events cost 1 more" is a proactive, persistent tax -- Stone's permanence identity, not Tide's reactive denial. Reverting to Stone (was Stone in R6, shifted to Tide in R7 for count-balancing). |
| Pallid Arbiter | Stone | Tide | "Disable Materialized abilities of enemies." Reactive denial of Materialized triggers is Tide's information-control identity. Frees a Stone slot (Stone count recovered through other means). |
| Data Pulse | Tide | Ember | QA flagged as poor Tide fit. "Gain 2 energy, Draw 1." Energy generation is explicitly Ember per identity docs, not Tide. Tempest accesses via Ember half. |
| Starcatcher | Ember | Stone | "When you play event, gain 1 energy." Persistent event-energy generation is Stone's incremental ramp identity (cf. Keeper of the Lightpath for event cost reduction). |
| Ashen Remnant | Ruin | Ember | "Abandon ally: Put void character on top of deck." Primary mechanic is abandon (Ember sacrifice identity). Void interaction is secondary. Cinder accesses via Ember. |

### Neutral Pool (24 cards)

All 23 v1 Neutral cards retained. 1 new card (Nexus of Passing) added.

## Distribution Statistics

### Per-Resonance Mono Counts

| Resonance | Existing | New | Total | Target | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| **Tide** | 37 | 3 | **40** | 38-45 | PASS |
| **Zephyr** | 43 | 0 | **43** | 38-45 | PASS |
| **Stone** | 33 | 7 | **40** | 38-45 | PASS (up from 31 in v1) |
| **Ember** | 44 | 1 | **45** | 38-45 | PASS |
| **Ruin** | 42 | 3 | **45** | 38-45 | PASS |
| **Subtotal Mono** | **199** | **14** | **213** | | |

### Other Categories

| Category | Existing | New | Total | Target | Status |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| **Neutral** | 23 | 1 | **24** | 15-25 | PASS |
| **Dual** | 0 | 10 | **10** | Exactly 10 | PASS |
| **Grand Total** | **222** | **25** | **247** | 247 | PASS |

### Per-Resonance Percentage

| Category | Count | % of 247 |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Mono resonance | 213 | 86.2% |
| Dual resonance | 10 | 4.0% |
| Neutral | 24 | 9.7% |

Target was ~80/10/10. Achieved 86/4/10. The lower dual percentage reflects the v2 policy of exactly 10 purpose-built signpost duals (vs. v1's 28 variable duals). The additional ~6% that was dual in v1 has been redistributed into mono resonances, strengthening individual resonance identities.

### Archetype Accessible Pool Sizes

Each archetype's accessible pool = mono-R1 + mono-R2 + duals for that pair + neutrals.

| Archetype | Pair | Mono-R1 | Mono-R2 | Dual | Neutral | Total Accessible |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Tempest** | Tide+Ember | 40 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **110** |
| **Mirage** | Tide+Zephyr | 40 | 43 | 1 | 24 | **108** |
| **Undertow** | Tide+Ruin | 40 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **110** |
| **Depths** | Tide+Stone | 40 | 40 | 1 | 24 | **105** |
| **Gale** | Zephyr+Ember | 43 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **113** |
| **Eclipse** | Zephyr+Ruin | 43 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **113** |
| **Basalt** | Zephyr+Stone | 43 | 40 | 1 | 24 | **108** |
| **Crucible** | Stone+Ember | 40 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **110** |
| **Cinder** | Ember+Ruin | 45 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **115** |
| **Bedrock** | Stone+Ruin | 40 | 45 | 1 | 24 | **110** |

All archetypes have accessible pools in the 105-115 range, well above the 60-80 minimum target. With exactly 1 dual signpost per archetype, the dual count is lower than v1, but each signpost card is specifically designed to be a high-impact archetype-defining card.

### Per-Tribe Distribution

**Warriors (21 existing + 3 new = 24 total)**

## Summary of Key Changes from V1

### 1. Dual Card Policy
V1 had 28 dual cards (13 existing + 15 new). V2 has exactly 10 dual cards, all from the 25 new v2 designs -- one per archetype pair. Every archetype now has exactly 1 high-impact dual signpost rather than a variable number (1-4 in v1). The 13 existing duals revert to mono-resonance with assignments that match their primary mechanical identity.

### 2. Stone Deficit Resolved
V1 had 31 mono-Stone. V2 has 40 mono-Stone through:
- 7 new mono-Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit, Deepvault Keeper, Everhold Protector, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden)
- Cloaked Sentinel reverted to Stone (+1)
- Starcatcher moved to Stone from Ember (+1)
- Surge of Fury from ex-dual to mono-Stone (+1)
- Offset by Pallid Arbiter to Tide (-1)

### 3. Mechanically Strained Assignments Fixed
- **Cloaked Sentinel:** Returned to Stone (proactive tax = Stone permanence, not Tide reactive denial)
- **Pallid Arbiter:** Moved to Tide (anti-Materialized is reactive information control = Tide)
- **Data Pulse:** Moved to Ember (energy generation is Ember, not Tide)
- **Starcatcher:** Moved to Stone (persistent event-energy is incremental ramp = Stone)
- **Ashen Remnant:** Moved to Ember (abandon payoff is Ember sacrifice identity)

### 4. V2 New Cards Address Critical Gaps
- **Depths** gains Watcher of the Fathoms (Tide+Stone dual) -- resolves the critical 1-signpost problem
- **Gale** gains Windstride Runner (Zephyr+Ember dual) -- resolves the critical 1-signpost problem
- **Crucible** gains Forgeborn Martyr with the "purity vs. power" tension the critiques requested
- **Bedrock** gains Roothold Keeper (void-only + Deepvault Keeper = economic engine)
- **Tempest** gains Stormtide Oracle using cumulative void-event count (not "2+ events this turn")
- **Eclipse** gains Voidthread Weaver with the discard-to-Reclaim engine Eclipse needed

### 5. Neutral Pool Appropriately Sized
24 neutral cards (22 draftable + 2 special) provide generic utility without over-diluting resonance identity. All 23 v1 neutrals retained; 1 new card (Nexus of Passing) added.

### 6. Ruin and Ember Load Acknowledged
Ruin at 45 mono and Ember at 45 mono are the highest mono counts, both at the ceiling of the 38-45 range. Ruin's load reflects the structural reality that 4 archetypes share Ruin, with sub-theme differentiation (void-volume for Undertow, discard-payoffs for Eclipse, Dissolved triggers for Cinder, expensive Reclaim for Bedrock). Ember's load reflects the large number of sacrifice/removal cards in the pool plus 3 ex-dual cards (Exiles, Eclipse Herald, Rebirth Ritualist) gaining Ember mono-resonance.
