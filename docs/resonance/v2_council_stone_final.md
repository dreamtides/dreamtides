## Summary of Positions Taken in Council Discussion

### Messages Sent (18 total — 2 rounds)

**Round 1 (16 messages):**
- **To Tide (4 msgs):** Starcatcher stays in Stone; Depths draft signal analysis; Pallid Arbiter subtype concern; Duskwatch Vigil + Watcher of the Fathoms as key Depths combo
- **To Ember (4 msgs):** Crucible purity-vs-power validation; Starcatcher position; Kindlespark Harvester in Cinder; Crucible anchor vs sacrifice tension; Forsworn Champion retag; Gale Cartographer trade proposal
- **To Zephyr (4 msgs):** Basalt auto-build analysis; Dreamtide Cartographer Tide→Zephyr shift support; anti-flicker tension in anchor cards; Conduit/Blazing Emberwing signal loss; Nexus of Passing as potential Basalt trap; Stoneveil Guardian quality; Gale accessibility deference
- **To Ruin (4 msgs):** Bedrock incoherence fix proposal; Ashen Avenger reassignment idea; Ruin competition for Bedrock enablers; Roothold Keeper spark + subtype changes; Ruin oversubscription analysis; Joint Bedrock upgrade package proposal

**Round 2 (2 messages — responding to Ruin and Zephyr):**
- **To Ruin (1 msg):** Full agreement on Bedrock gap analysis; adopted Gravevault Warden design over my Vaultstone Harbinger (kindle 1 > extra energy); agreed anchor cards are anti-Bedrock not just neutral; proposed Spirit of the Greenwood swap if Stone must stay at 40; committed to joint Stone-Ruin recommendation to team lead
- **To Zephyr (1 msg):** Conditional support for Emerald Guardian SA→Ancient conversion; refused second SA conversion (6 is floor); confirmed shared ramp split is correct; agreed auto-build concern is mitigated by non-SA decision complexity; Starcatcher alliance confirmed; Mirage-Basalt Stone card competition is healthy draft tension

### Key Proposals Made
1. Starcatcher stays in Stone; remove "Tempest" from archetype tag (alliance with Zephyr advocate)
2. Dreamtide Cartographer Tide→Zephyr (support integration review recommendation)
3. Add "Depths" to Dreamtide Cartographer archetype tag (if it stays Tide)
4. Roothold Keeper bump to 1 spark
5. **Gravevault Warden** — new Stone card with void-play trigger for Bedrock (joint proposal with Ruin advocate, replaces earlier Vaultstone Harbinger pitch)
6. Data Pulse Ember→Tide to compensate for Cartographer shift
7. Joint Stone+Ruin coordinated Bedrock upgrade package
8. Conditional Emerald Guardian SA→Ancient subtype conversion (if playtesting confirms auto-build, agreed with Zephyr advocate)

### Key Alliances Formed
- **Stone+Ruin on Bedrock:** Full alignment on Gravevault Warden design and Bedrock upgrade package
- **Stone+Zephyr on Starcatcher:** Joint position that Starcatcher stays in Stone
- **Stone+Zephyr on Basalt auto-build:** Agreed Emerald Guardian is the right SA conversion candidate, but only with playtesting evidence

## Final Archetype Assessments

### 1. DEPTHS (Tide+Stone) -- B- (7.0/10)

**Final Grade: B- (7.0/10) -- No Change from Health Check**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 7/10 | 29 explicitly tagged cards; deep Prevent suite (10 cards) |
| Signpost Quality | 8/10 | Watcher of the Fathoms is excellent -- hand-size kindle + Prevent-trigger energy |
| Mechanical Coherence | 7/10 | Tide denial + Stone permanence cohere well; Stone tribal dilution is structural |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 6/10 | Worst in format; Stone signals are noisy (Warrior/SA tribal obscures Depths cards) |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 7/10 | Fortress Control and Midrange Value are genuinely distinct |
| **Average** | **7.0** | |

**What V2 Fixed:**
- The critical signpost problem is resolved. Watcher of the Fathoms creates a unique play pattern that rewards being in both Tide and Stone simultaneously.
- Duskwatch Vigil converts Prevents into tempo, solving the "reactive control falls behind on board development" problem. The Duskwatch + Watcher loop makes Depths energy-neutral when countering threats.
- Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden give Depths proactive finisher axes (ticking kindle clock, board-wide spark pump) that address the slow win condition complaint.
- Kindlespark Harvester gives Depths access to repeatable removal through the spark-spending mechanic.

**What Remains Problematic:**
- **Stone pool dilution.** Only 18-22 of Stone's 40 cards serve Depths. The Warrior (12) and Spirit Animal (7) tribal packages are dead weight for the control archetype. This is structural and cannot be fully fixed without redesigning Stone's identity.
- **Draft signal clarity (6/10).** The worst in the format. When Stone Warrior cards wheel, it could mean Crucible is closed OR that Stone-for-Depths is open. The signals are indistinguishable. Only 5 Stone cards unambiguously signal Depths.
- **Smallest accessible pool (105).** Tied with no one. Both Tide and Stone sit at exactly 40, the floor of the target range.
- **No "close the game" finisher.** Depths wins through kindle accumulation and persistent bodies. Against Gale (fast 15+ points by turn 4-5) or Cinder (sacrifice engine generates points through Fathomless Maw), Depths needs time it may not have.

**Recommended Changes:**
1. Add "Depths" to Dreamtide Cartographer's archetype tag (tag change only -- the spark mode is a genuine Depths finisher-accelerator)
2. If Dreamtide Cartographer moves to Zephyr (per integration review), this makes it inaccessible to Depths. Push for compensation: Data Pulse returning to Tide would give Depths a cheap draw+energy cantrip.
3. Long-term: consider 1-2 Stone cards with explicit Depths-only appeal (e.g., a Stone event that mills or a character that gains value from Prevent).

**Key Interactions to Highlight:**
- Duskwatch Vigil + Watcher of the Fathoms = Prevent becomes energy-positive
- Everhold Protector + Prevent suite = ticking clock behind counter-magic wall
- Ironbark Warden + persistent board = cumulative spark pump
- Dreamtide Cartographer (spark mode) + full hand = board-wide +1 spark per Judgment

### 2. BASALT (Zephyr+Stone) -- B+ (7.8/10)

**Final Grade: B+ (7.8/10) -- No Change from Health Check**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 9/10 | 33+ on-plan cards; deepest tribal core in format |
| Signpost Quality | 7/10 | Stoneveil Guardian: functional mode-switch, but lacks splash appeal |
| Mechanical Coherence | 9/10 | Deploy → ramp → convert pipeline is tight and self-reinforcing |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 8/10 | SA tribal is loud and clear; some shared ramp picks are ambiguous |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 6/10 | Auto-build risk; most builds converge on similar 25-card shells |
| **Average** | **7.8** | |

**What V2 Fixed:**
- New non-SA Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit) create "dilute tribal for power" decisions that partially address the auto-build problem.
- Ironveil Watcher in the Judgment Storm build creates a distinct variant where point generation replaces pure spark accumulation.
- Surge of Fury (now mono-Stone, was dual) doubles Judgment phases, amplifying the ramp→convert pipeline.

**What Remains Problematic:**
- **Auto-build convergence (6/10 flexibility).** 33 on-plan cards for 25-card decks means the marginal decision is "which SA over which SA" rather than "should I include this non-SA." The two builds (Spirit Engine vs Judgment Storm) share most of the same core. **Mitigating factor (from Zephyr discussion):** The 4 new non-SA Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran, Vanguard of the Summit, Everhold Protector) increase total viable card count but also increase decision COMPLEXITY — they create "include this or another SA?" tension, which is the antidote to auto-build, not the cause. More viable options ≠ more auto-build when the options create tension with each other. Zephyr advocate proposed Emerald Guardian SA→Ancient conversion as a contingency fix; I conditionally support this if playtesting confirms homogeneity.
- **Mass removal fragility.** Most SA bodies have 1 spark. A single Burst of Obliteration (pay 2 energy: dissolve all characters with spark < 2) wipes the entire board. No cards in Basalt's pool specifically protect against this.
- **Event starvation.** Only 3 high-priority events (Spirit Bond, Light of Emergence, Surge of Fury). Spirit of Smoldering Echoes and Starcatcher (event payoffs in Stone) are weak in Basalt's creature-heavy builds.
- **Stoneveil Guardian signpost at 7/10.** Lowest-rated signpost in my portfolio. Functional but does not create the "build-around magnetism" of top-tier signposts.
- **Conduit of Resonance and Blazing Emberwing lost dual resonance.** These core Basalt engine pieces are now mono-Zephyr, meaning they provide no Stone signal. A drafter picking them knows they're in Zephyr but doesn't get the "go Basalt specifically" signal a dual card would provide.

**Recommended Changes:**
1. No major structural changes needed. Basalt is healthy.
2. Consider whether Nexus of Passing's Basalt tag is justified -- in my analysis, the card is stronger in Mirage (flicker = 2 transitions per character) than in Basalt (deployment-only transitions). Basalt might be better served by a different Neutral tag.
3. Stoneveil Guardian could potentially be improved with explicit SA reference in the text (e.g., "Judgment: If you have 3 or more allies, gain 2 energy. Otherwise, each allied Spirit Animal gains +1 spark...") but this risks overloading an uncommon.

**Key Interactions to Highlight:**
- Conduit of Resonance + Ironveil Watcher = each materialize triggers all Judgment abilities, generating 1-3 points per materialize
- Surge of Fury + any Judgment-heavy board = double energy generation, double kindle, double point scoring
- Vanguard of the Summit + cheap SAs + Nexus Wayfinder = 3rd character draws 2 + gains 2 energy
- Boundless Wanderer counts as SA for all tribal payoffs (hidden gem)

### 3. CRUCIBLE (Stone+Ember) -- B+ (7.6/10)

**Final Grade: B+ (7.6/10) -- No Change from Health Check**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core Depth | 8/10 | Deepest Warrior tribal core; 20 accessible Warriors |
| Signpost Quality | 9/10 | Forgeborn Martyr: Warrior pump + board-width death dividend |
| Mechanical Coherence | 7/10 | Deliberate constructive incoherence via non-Warrior power pieces |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 8/10 | Warrior-specific cards are unambiguous; energy ramp is shared with Basalt |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 6/10 | Improved from v1's 3-4/10; purity-vs-power tension is real |
| **Average** | **7.6** | |

**What V2 Fixed (This is the best-executed fix in v2):**
- **Rails score: 9/10 → 6/10.** Five non-Warrior power pieces (Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden, Everhold Protector) each create a genuine "include this or another Warrior for Blade of Unity" decision.
- **Two distinct builds emerge:** "Warrior Phalanx" (pure tribal, Blade of Unity at 6-8 spark) and "Crucible Engine" (Judgment storm, multiple independent win conditions).
- **Forgeborn Martyr's death trigger fix** ("if 3+ allies" instead of "by opponent") makes the signpost Cinder-compatible without removing the board-investment requirement.
- **Kindlespark Harvester** introduces an entirely new "spark as spendable resource" axis unique in the format.

**What Remains Problematic:**
- **Still the most linear archetype.** Both builds care about deploying Warriors, pumping them, and scoring via Judgment. The AXIS doesn't change -- only the tools do. Compare to Eclipse (discard-aggro vs discard-engine) or Mirage (tempo flicker vs engine flicker).
- **Warrior recursion requires Ruin.** Risen Champion and Ashen Avenger are mono-Ruin, inaccessible to Crucible. Crucible's recursion options are limited to Grim Reclaimer (mono-Ember, abandon → reclaim Warrior) and Speaker for the Forgotten (mono-Stone, play Warrior → reclaim random cost 3).
- **Removal entirely Ember-dependent.** Zero dissolve effects in Stone. Crucible's fast-speed interaction is 100% Ember-sourced. In a draft where Gale and Cinder also compete for Ember removal, Crucible can be starved.
- **Anchor vs sacrifice tension needs navigating.** Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden reward board persistence; Dreadcall Warden and Forsworn Champion reward sacrifice. These work against each other in the same deck but define distinct sub-builds. New players may not recognize the tension immediately.
- **Event poverty in Stone.** Only 4 Stone events (Summons of the Bonded, Break the Veil, Lurking Dread, Surge of Fury). Starcatcher ("when you play event, gain 1 energy") is a near-dead card in most Crucible builds.

**Recommended Changes:**
1. **Starcatcher archetype tag update:** Remove "Tempest" (inaccessible); add or maintain "Basalt" (legitimate). Consider removing from Crucible context -- it's a trap card in creature-heavy Crucible builds.
2. **Forsworn Champion retag consideration:** Currently "Crucible, Cinder." In pure Crucible (Warrior Phalanx build), the sacrifice effect is anti-synergistic. Could be retagged as "Cinder-primary, Crucible-secondary" to guide drafters.
3. No structural changes needed. Crucible is working as designed.

**Key Interactions to Highlight:**
- Ironveil Watcher + Surge of Fury = up to 6 direct points per turn (3 per Judgment phase × 2 phases)
- Kindlespark Harvester + Skyflame Commander/Forgeborn Martyr = accumulated spark → repeatable removal
- Ironbark Warden + wide Warrior board = cumulative +1 spark per Judgment to all surviving allies
- Forgeborn Martyr + 3+ allies + opponent's removal = death dividend (draw 1, gain 1 energy per Warrior dissolved)

### 4. BEDROCK (Stone+Ruin) -- C+ (6.8/10) → Proposed B- (7.0/10) with recommended changes

**Current Grade: C+ (6.8/10)**
**Proposed Grade (with recommended changes): B- (7.0/10)**

| Dimension | Current | With Changes | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Core Depth | 7/10 | 7/10 | Multi-layered reanimation targets at different cost points |
| Signpost Quality | 7/10 | 7.5/10 | Roothold Keeper at 1 spark improves scoring contribution |
| Mechanical Coherence | 6/10 | 7/10 | New Stone void-play bridge card resolves the worst incoherence |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 7/10 | 7/10 | Void-only mechanic is clean; Deepvault Keeper is unambiguous |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 7/10 | 7/10 | Three builds: Crypt Engine, Warrior Undying, Value Grind |
| **Average** | **6.8** | **7.1** | |

**What V2 Fixed:**
- **3 void-only characters** (up from 1): Revenant of the Lost, Roothold Keeper, Risen Champion. The "Revenant or bust" problem is solved.
- **Deepvault Keeper** creates a real economic engine: characters from void cost 1 less. Roothold Keeper becomes net-1 energy from void (or net-0 with Deepvault Keeper).
- **Risen Champion** adds a void-only Warrior with chain-reclaim on Dissolved: bridges to both Warrior tribal and reanimator strategies.
- **Speaker for the Forgotten** bridges Stone Warriors to Ruin recursion.
- **Expanded accessible pool:** 23 core cards → 110 total accessible.

**What Remains Critically Problematic:**

**Problem A: Stone-Ruin Mechanical Incoherence (6/10 -- lowest in format).**
Stone's identity (permanence, Judgment scoring, tribal density) and Ruin's identity (void interaction, transience, recursion) are near-opposites. Only 3 cards bridge both: Deepvault Keeper, Speaker for the Forgotten, Nexus Wayfinder. The effective Stone pool for Bedrock is 10-15 cards (of 40) -- far less than any other archetype gets from its second color.

**Problem A.1: Anchor Effects Are Actively Anti-Bedrock (NEW — from Ruin advocate discussion).**
Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden ("been on the battlefield since your last turn") are not merely neutral for Bedrock — they are hostile. A character played from void this turn fails the anchor check. Bedrock's core loop (play from void → die → reclaim → play from void again) is the opposite of "stay in play for multiple turns." These cards were designed for Depths/Crucible permanence, and they actively punish Bedrock's recursion pattern. This sharpens the incoherence problem: not only does Bedrock get few useful Stone cards, some of the new Stone cards are anti-synergistic with its identity.

**Problem B: Only 1 Stone Card Bridges to Void Play.**
Deepvault Keeper is the sole Stone card that participates in Bedrock's core void-play identity. Every other Stone card either serves Crucible (Warriors), Basalt (Spirit Animals), or Depths (control bodies). This is the most fixable problem in the format.

**Problem C: Top-Heavy Curve with Two-Piece Combo Dependency.**
Bedrock requires BOTH filling the void AND finding enablers. When one half is missing, the deck has the lowest floor in the format. The reanimation targets (Revenant 3, Titan 6, Rising God 9, Devourer 8) are spectacular but require setup.

**Problem D: Ruin Enabler Competition.**
Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, and Reclaimer of Lost Paths are shared with Undertow, Eclipse, and Cinder. Bedrock is the weakest competitor because Stone provides the least synergistic support for void play.

**Problem E: Roothold Keeper at 0 Spark.**
Every other signpost contributes to scoring. Roothold Keeper is pure engine -- it dilutes board scoring potential by occupying a battlefield slot with 0 Judgment points. At 2-cost with a void-only restriction, 1 spark would be fair.

**Recommended Changes (Coordinated Stone+Ruin Package):**

| # | Change | Impact | Effort |
|---|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **New Stone card with void-play trigger** | Addresses Problem A+B; +1 mechanical coherence | Requires Stone count adjustment |
| 2 | **Roothold Keeper to 1 spark** | Addresses Problem E; signpost contributes to scoring | Balance tweak |
| 3 | **Add Bedrock to Tidechannel Observer archetype tag** | Acknowledges legitimate Bedrock use case | Tag change only |
| 4 | **Explore Ruin card rewarding expensive Reclaim** | Addresses Problem D; differentiates from Undertow | Requires Ruin count adjustment |

**New Stone Card Proposal (for Problem A+B) — JOINT STONE-RUIN RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Name:** Gravevault Warden (designed by Ruin advocate, endorsed by Stone advocate)
- **Cost:** 3 energy
- **Type:** Character
- **Subtype:** Ancient
- **Spark:** 1
- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Resonance:** Stone
- **Ability:** "When you materialize a character from your void, gain 1 energy and kindle 1."
- **Primary Archetypes:** Bedrock (primary), Depths (secondary), Crucible (tertiary via Grim Reclaimer/Speaker loops)
- **Why this design is superior to earlier "Vaultstone Harbinger" pitch:**
  - Kindle 1 creates visible board impact connecting to Stone's spark-accumulation identity (Ironbark Warden, Ironveil Watcher, Mystic Runefish), whereas extra energy is fungible and forgettable
  - Gives Bedrock incremental spark generation from its void-play loop — something it desperately lacks
  - The Roothold Keeper + Deepvault Keeper + Gravevault Warden trio creates a sustainable engine: play from void → draw 1, gain 1 energy, kindle 1
  - Ancient subtype bridges to Depths (Watcher of the Fathoms) without diluting Crucible's Warrior count or triggering Basalt's SA payoffs
  - Narrow enough that only Bedrock (and maybe Crucible-splash) genuinely wants it
- **Slot source:** Stone is at 40 (floor of 40-45 range). Option A: raise to 41 (within bounds). Option B: swap Spirit of the Greenwood (Basalt-only, 0 spark, generic one-shot — weakest Stone card), which also reduces SA density by 1 (partially addresses auto-build concern flagged by Zephyr advocate).

**Key Interactions to Highlight:**
- **Gravevault Warden + Deepvault Keeper + Roothold Keeper** = the Bedrock Engine: play Roothold from void → cost reduced by 1 (Deepvault) → gain 1 energy + kindle 1 (Gravevault) → draw 1 card (Roothold) = net-0 energy, +1 kindle, +1 card per loop iteration
- Deepvault Keeper + Roothold Keeper = net-0 energy, cantripping void creature loop
- Risen Champion + Warrior board = dissolved chain-reclaim creates resilient board state
- Architect of Memory (void 7+) + expensive bodies = mass Reclaim for game-ending boards
- Speaker for the Forgotten + Warrior plays = continuous Reclaim without requiring void threshold
- **Gravevault Warden reduces Ruin infrastructure dependency** — even without Architect of Memory, Bedrock can generate incremental value from its Stone side via void-play triggers

## Cross-Archetype Summary

### Stone's V2 Report Card

| Archetype | Grade | Change from V1 | Priority |
|-----------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Basalt | B+ (7.8) | Slight drop (A- → B+) | Low -- healthy, no major changes needed |
| Crucible | B+ (7.6) | Stable (B+ → B+) | Low -- rails fix is the best-executed change in v2 |
| Depths | B- (7.0) | Improved (C+ → B-) | Medium -- draft signal clarity needs work |
| Bedrock | C+ (6.8) | Improved (B- → C+*) | **HIGH -- weakest archetype, needs coordinated fix** |

*Note: The health check grades don't map perfectly. V1 Bedrock was B- with 23 core cards. V2 Bedrock is C+ (6.8/10) in the 10-point system, which reflects a different grading scale. In absolute terms, Bedrock IS improved from v1 -- more void-only characters, economic engine, build diversity. But relative to the v2 format where every other archetype got significant upgrades, Bedrock's relative position dropped.

### What Stone Got Right in V2
1. **The deficit fix is numerically complete.** 31 → 40, within target range.
2. **Every new Stone card serves 2-3 archetypes.** The multi-archetype design principle was executed flawlessly.
3. **Crucible's purity-vs-power tension** is the single best design achievement in v2.
4. **Kindlespark Harvester** introduces an entirely new mechanic (spark as spendable resource) that received universal praise in both audits.

### What Stone Still Needs
1. **1 more Stone-Bedrock bridge card.** The deficit fix disproportionately helped Crucible and Basalt, not Bedrock. Deepvault Keeper is alone.
2. **Starcatcher archetype tag cleanup.** Remove "Tempest" from the tag; the card is mechanically Stone-coded and Tempest can absorb the loss.
3. **Depths signal improvement.** The Stone-side draft signal for Depths is the weakest in the format. More explicit Depths-only Stone cards would help, but this is a long-term structural concern, not an acute crisis.

### Trades I Support
- **Gravevault Warden addition** (joint Stone-Ruin proposal — highest priority, fixes format's weakest archetype)
- **Spirit of the Greenwood removal** (if Gravevault Warden requires a swap to keep Stone at 40; also reduces SA auto-build)
- **Dreamtide Cartographer Tide→Zephyr** (helps Gale, the most underserved archetype; costs Depths a supplementary card)
- **Data Pulse Ember→Tide** (compensates Tide for Cartographer loss)
- **Roothold Keeper 1 spark** (minor balance tweak, makes signpost contribute to scoring)
- **Emerald Guardian SA→Ancient conversion** (conditional on playtesting confirming auto-build; agreed with Zephyr advocate)
- **Starcatcher archetype tag cleanup** — remove "Tempest," maintain "Basalt" (joint position with Zephyr advocate)
- Any archetype tag updates that improve signal clarity without changing card resonances

### Trades I Oppose
- **Starcatcher back to Ember.** Stone needs the count, the mechanic fits Stone, and Tempest is healthy without it. (Zephyr advocate supports this position.)
- **Any Stone card reassignment that drops Stone below 40** (unless offset by Gravevault Warden addition). We fought hard for this count; we protect it.
- **Making Everhold Protector or Ironbark Warden dual-resonance.** The anti-flicker tension is intentional and healthy for Basalt's "stay and fight" identity. These cards should stay mono-Stone.
- **Converting more than 1 SA to non-SA subtype.** SA density at 6 (after potential Emerald Guardian conversion) is the floor for Basalt tribal critical mass. Dropping to 5 risks undermining the archetype.
