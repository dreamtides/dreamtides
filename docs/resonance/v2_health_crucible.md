# V2 Archetype Health Check: Crucible (Stone+Ember)

## Identity: Warrior Tribal + Lords

Crucible is the go-wide Warrior tribal archetype. Its game plan: deploy cheap Warriors, pump them with lords (Skyflame Commander, Forgeborn Martyr), scale Blade of Unity, convert surplus energy from Judgment ramp into kindle via Stoneheart Veteran, and close with Surge of Fury for an extra Judgment phase.

## 2. Ratings

### Core Depth: 8/10

Crucible has the deepest tribal core in the format. The Warrior suite is layered across multiple roles:
- **Ramp:** Ethereal Trailblazer (0-cost energy), Wolfbond Chieftain (0-cost conditional energy), Dawnblade Wanderer (Legendary engine), Bloomweaver (materialize energy)
- **Lords:** Skyflame Commander (+1 spark static), Forgeborn Martyr (+1 spark EOT Judgment), Company Commander (grow on materialize)
- **Scaling:** Blade of Unity (spark = Warrior count), Assault Leader (activated pump)
- **Tutoring:** Seeker for the Way, Summons of the Bonded
- **Removal:** Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade, Ride of the Vanguard
- **Recursion:** Speaker for the Forgotten, Ashen Avenger (from Ruin pool, accessible via splash)
- **Sacrifice-bridge:** Dreadcall Warden, Forsworn Champion, The Dread Sovereign, Grim Reclaimer, Blade of Oblivion

The addition of Stoneheart Veteran (energy sink -> kindle), Forgeborn Martyr (dual lord + death dividend), and Ironveil Watcher (Judgment storm points) gives the core even more endgame payoffs. The 12 mono-Stone Warriors + 5 Ember Warriors + Forgeborn Martyr + Aspiring Guardian + Boundless Wanderer = 20 dedicated Warriors accessible in the pool, which is exceptional density.

**Weakness:** The core is DEEP but narrowly scoped. Almost all the truly powerful cards are in the same Warrior tribal lane.

### Signpost Quality: 9/10

Forgeborn Martyr is a superb signpost:
- **Clear signal:** Dual Stone+Ember, Warrior subtype, explicitly pumps Warriors. A drafter who sees this immediately understands "go-wide Warriors."
- **Multi-dimensional:** Two distinct abilities (Judgment pump + death dividend) that create different play patterns. The Judgment pump is bread-and-butter; the death dividend rewards having 3+ allies, meaning you need board width, not just Warrior count.
- **Cross-archetype reach:** The "if 3+ allies" clause (replacing v1's "by opponent") makes the death dividend self-sacrifice-compatible (Cinder), which was the critical fix from the synergy audit.
- **Not essential:** A Crucible deck functions without Forgeborn Martyr (Skyflame Commander is the budget lord). The signpost adds power, not dependency.

Only missing a 10/10 because the card is Rare rarity, which makes it slightly less available in draft than an Uncommon signpost would be.

### Mechanical Coherence: 7/10

The core Warrior tribal package is tightly coherent: play Warriors, pump them, convert Judgment triggers into energy/points/spark. But the v2 additions introduce deliberate tension that slightly fractures coherence (by design):

- **Anchor/presence mechanics** (Everhold Protector, Ironbark Warden) reward keeping characters on the battlefield across turns, which synergizes with go-wide but creates tension with sacrifice payoffs (Ember's abandon cards).
- **Non-Warrior value pieces** (Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden) are mechanically aligned with Crucible's Judgment-heavy game plan but dilute Warrior count for Blade of Unity.
- **Spark-spending** (Kindlespark Harvester) is a novel axis that converts accumulated kindle/pump into removal -- coherent with the game plan but requires understanding when to spend vs. accumulate.

This is actually a *good* kind of incoherence -- it creates deckbuilding decisions rather than a formulaic build. The v1 version was 9/10 on rails precisely because everything pointed in one direction. The 7/10 here reflects that the various sub-plans (pure Warrior tribal, Judgment storm, anchor/presence, sacrifice-bridge) don't all synergize with each other, which is the point.

### Draft Signal Clarity: 8/10

Crucible's signals are among the clearest in the format:
- **Strong signals:** Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity, Company Commander, Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade, Ride of the Vanguard -- all explicitly mention Warriors. If you see these wheeling, Crucible is open.
- **Moderate signals:** Surge of Fury, Ironveil Watcher, Stoneheart Veteran -- these could go Basalt or Crucible but strongly imply a Judgment-heavy deck.
- **Weak signals:** Energy ramp pieces (Dawnblade Wanderer, Bloomweaver, Arc Gate Opening) are generic enough that they don't signal Crucible specifically.

The 8/10 (not 9 or 10) is because several of the best new cards (Ironveil Watcher, Ironbark Warden, Vanguard of the Summit) are non-Warriors that are also wanted by Basalt. A Crucible drafter and a Basalt drafter may fight over Stone cards without clear lane separation until the Warrior-specific payoffs come around.

### Deckbuilding Flexibility: 6/10

Improved significantly from v1 (which would have been 3-4/10) but still the most linear archetype. The flexibility comes from:

1. **Warrior purity slider:** How many of your 20+ available Warriors do you actually run? Blade of Unity wants all of them; but Ironbark Warden, Ironveil Watcher, Vanguard of the Summit, and Kindlespark Harvester are all non-Warriors that offer powerful Judgment-phase payoffs.

2. **Sacrifice sub-build:** The Dread Sovereign, Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, Blade of Oblivion, and Grim Reclaimer (all from Ember) create a sacrifice-aggro variant that plays differently from the pure pump-and-score version.

3. **Anchor vs. aggro:** Everhold Protector and Ironbark Warden reward keeping characters alive across turns (control-oriented), while sacrifice cards and Surge of Fury reward fast deployment and exploitation (aggro-oriented). These are genuinely different deck configurations.

The 6/10 ceiling is because even with these sub-options, the deck always cares about deploying Warriors, pumping them, and scoring via Judgment. The strategic axis doesn't shift the way, say, Eclipse can pivot between discard-aggro and discard-engine.

## 3. Top 3 Hidden Gems

### 1. Ironveil Watcher (Stone, NEW -- 2 cost, Ancient, 0 spark)
*Judgment: Gain 1 point for each other Judgment trigger this phase, up to 3.*

This card is deceptively strong in Crucible. A typical midgame Crucible board has 3-5 characters with Judgment abilities (Wolfbond Chieftain, Ethereal Trailblazer, Spirit Field Reclaimer, Skyflame Commander's lord pump makes others matter). With Surge of Fury doubling the Judgment phase, Ironveil Watcher can generate 6 points per turn. At 2 cost with 0 spark, it looks unimpressive -- but the direct point generation bypasses the spark-to-points conversion entirely, functioning as a win condition rather than a support piece.

**Hidden because:** 0 spark and Ancient subtype make it look like a Basalt card. Crucible drafters focused on Warrior count may pass it, but its ceiling in a Judgment-dense board is format-defining.

### 2. Kindlespark Harvester (Stone, NEW -- 3 cost, Ancient, 0 spark)
*Judgment: Remove 3 spark from leftmost to dissolve enemy cost 3 or less; kindle 2.*

This introduces a mechanic that doesn't exist anywhere else in the format: spending spark as a removal resource. In Crucible, Skyflame Commander + Forgeborn Martyr typically stack 4-6 spark on the leftmost Warrior. Spending 3 to dissolve an enemy and then kindling 2 back means you net -1 spark on leftmost but remove a blocker AND distribute 2 kindle elsewhere. With Surge of Fury, you can fire this twice per turn. It is targeted removal on a Judgment trigger -- something Crucible normally lacks.

**Hidden because:** 0 spark, non-Warrior, requires understanding the spark economy to evaluate. First-time Crucible drafters will not see the line; experienced ones will recognize it as the archetype's best removal piece.

### 3. Boundless Wanderer (Neutral -- 2 cost, all subtypes, 2 spark)
*Has all character types. Judgment: With 3+ allies sharing a type, draw 1.*

As a Neutral with all types, this is often overlooked for Crucible specifically. But it counts as a Warrior for Blade of Unity, Skyflame Commander, Company Commander, Fury of the Clan, Ride of the Vanguard -- every single tribal payoff. At 2 cost and 2 spark, it has better baseline stats than most dedicated Warriors. The Judgment draw is easily activated (3+ Warriors is trivial). It is essentially the best "23rd card" for any Crucible deck but rarely discussed as a Crucible piece because it lives in the neutral pool.

**Hidden because:** Neutral cards get evaluated generically. Crucible drafters hunting for Warriors in Stone and Ember may forget that this all-type body is always available and always excellent.

## 4. Two Different Builds + Purity vs. Power Analysis

### Build A: "Warrior Phalanx" (Pure Tribal)

**Core (18-20 cards):**
- Ethereal Trailblazer, Wolfbond Chieftain, Aspiring Guardian (0-cost bodies)
- Bloomweaver, Dawnblade Wanderer (1-cost ramp Warriors)
- Skyflame Commander, Company Commander, Blade of Unity (2-cost lords/scaling)
- Spirit Field Reclaimer (2-cost kindle)
- Seeker for the Way, Twilight Suppressor (3-cost utility Warriors)
- Assault Leader, Stoneheart Veteran [NEW] (3-cost payoffs)
- Forsworn Champion (4-cost sacrifice-growth)
- Forgeborn Martyr (3-cost dual signpost lord)
- Boundless Wanderer (2-cost pseudo-Warrior)
- Dreadcall Warden (2-cost card draw)

**Support (5-7 cards):**
- Summons of the Bonded, Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade (cheap Warrior-matters spells)
- Ride of the Vanguard (fast pump)
- Surge of Fury (extra Judgment)
- Data Pulse (energy + draw)
- Arc Gate Opening or Glimpse of Infinity (energy burst)

**Warrior density:** 16-18 of ~25 cards = 64-72% Warrior
**Blade of Unity ceiling:** 6-8 spark (excellent)
**Strengths:** Maximum lord value, maximum Blade of Unity, excellent Judgment scoring
**Weaknesses:** Extremely vulnerable to Apocalypse/Burst of Obliteration, no recovery from board wipes, minimal draw outside Dreadcall Warden

### Build B: "Crucible Engine" (Judgment Storm + Purity Breakers)

**Core Warriors (12-14 cards):**
- Ethereal Trailblazer, Wolfbond Chieftain (0-cost Judgment energy)
- Bloomweaver, Dawnblade Wanderer (1-cost ramp)
- Skyflame Commander, Blade of Unity (2-cost lord/scaling)
- Spirit Field Reclaimer (2-cost kindle)
- Seeker for the Way (3-cost tutor)
- Stoneheart Veteran [NEW] (3-cost energy sink)
- Forgeborn Martyr (3-cost signpost)

**Non-Warrior Power Pieces (6-8 cards):**
- Ironveil Watcher [NEW] (2-cost, Judgment points)
- Everhold Protector [NEW] (2-cost, presence kindle)
- Kindlespark Harvester [NEW] (3-cost, spark removal)
- Ironbark Warden [NEW] (4-cost, presence pump)
- Invoker of Myths (4-cost, Warrior materialize draw)
- Vanguard of the Summit [NEW] (4-cost, deployment storm payoff)

**Support (4-6 cards):**
- Surge of Fury (extra Judgment -- this card DOUBLES Ironveil Watcher and Kindlespark Harvester)
- Fury of the Clan, Judgment of the Blade (removal)
- Data Pulse, Arc Gate Opening (energy)

**Warrior density:** 12-14 of ~25 cards = 48-56% Warrior
**Blade of Unity ceiling:** 4-5 spark (moderate)
**Strengths:** Multiple independent win conditions (Ironveil Watcher points, Ironbark Warden pump, Kindlespark Harvester removal + kindle), more resilient to board wipes, stronger long-game
**Weaknesses:** Blade of Unity is weaker, Skyflame Commander's lord effect applies to fewer bodies, less explosive turn-one-Judgment potential

### Does V2 Create "Purity vs. Power" Tension?

**Yes -- this is the single biggest improvement over v1.** The analysis:

**In v1**, the optimal Crucible deck was obvious: maximize Warrior count, maximize lord density, maximize Blade of Unity. Every non-Warrior card was strictly worse than a Warrior. The archetype was 9/10 on rails because there was no reason NOT to draft every Warrior you saw.

**In v2**, five new non-Warrior cards compete directly for Crucible's limited card slots:

| Non-Warrior | What it offers | What Warrior slot it replaces | Blade of Unity cost |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Ironveil Watcher | 1-3 direct points per Judgment | Replaces a 0-spark Warrior | -1 Blade of Unity spark, but gains raw points |
| Vanguard of the Summit | Draw 2 + 2 energy burst | Replaces a 4-cost mid-tier Warrior | -1 Blade of Unity spark, but refuels hand |
| Kindlespark Harvester | Repeatable removal | Replaces a combat Warrior | -1 Blade of Unity spark, but removes threats |
| Ironbark Warden | Board-wide +1 spark pump | Competes with Assault Leader's role | -1 Blade of Unity, but pumps all allies (not just Warriors) |
| Everhold Protector | Passive kindle accumulation | Replaces a cheap Warrior body | -1 Blade of Unity, but adds guaranteed value |

Each of these creates a genuine decision: "Is the ceiling of Blade of Unity at 7 spark worth more than having Ironveil Watcher score 3 points per Judgment?" The answer depends on the draft: if you got two Blade of Unity, staying pure is correct; if you have only one, the non-Warrior payoffs are likely superior.

**The tension is real and well-calibrated.** The non-Warriors are powerful enough that including 3-4 of them creates a fundamentally different deck (Build B) that wins through Judgment point generation rather than pure Warrior spark. But they are NOT so powerful that they obsolete the Warrior core -- Build A remains competitive. This is exactly what a healthy archetype looks like.

---

## 5. Problems Flagged

### Problem 1: STILL somewhat on-rails, but improved (v1: 9/10 -> v2: 6/10)

The purity-vs-power tension genuinely helps. But Crucible remains the most linear archetype in the format. Both Build A and Build B still:
- Deploy cheap Warriors early
- Play lords to pump them
- Score via Judgment phase
- Use Surge of Fury for explosive turns

The AXIS of the archetype never changes -- it is always "Judgment phase scoring." The new cards create variation in HOW you score (spark vs. direct points) but not in WHEN or WHY you score. Compare to Eclipse, which can pivot between discard-aggro (empty hand, score through Forgotten Titan tempo) and discard-engine (Voidthread Weaver value loops). Crucible's two builds are more like "same plan, different tools" than "different plans."

**Verdict:** Improved from 9/10 rails to approximately 6/10 rails. Acceptable for a tribal archetype, which inherently constrains flexibility. No further action needed -- this is a structural feature of Warrior tribal, not a design failure.

### Problem 2: Event poverty in the Stone half

Crucible has access to only 3 Stone events: Summons of the Bonded, Break the Veil, Lurking Dread, and Surge of Fury. (Technically 4.) Compare to the 14 Ember events. This means Crucible is almost entirely character-based, which is fine for the archetype's identity but creates a problem: Starcatcher (Stone, "when you play event: gain 1 energy") is in Crucible's pool but has almost nothing to trigger in a typical Crucible build. Similarly, Cloaked Sentinel ("opponent events cost +1") is in the pool but functions as a Depths card, not a Crucible card.

**Severity: Low.** These cards being "traps" in Crucible is fine -- not every card in the pool needs to be good for the archetype. But it slightly reduces the effective pool size. Crucible's 110-card pool is more like 85-90 functionally playable cards once you remove the Spirit Animal package (7 cards relevant only to Basalt splash), the Depths control package (~5 cards), and the off-theme events.

### Problem 3: Warrior recursion requires Ruin access

The v2 Crucible-Bedrock bridge cards (Risen Champion, Deepvault Keeper, Ashen Avenger) are designed to give Crucible access to Warrior recursion. But:
- Risen Champion is mono-Ruin (NOT in Crucible's accessible pool)
- Ashen Avenger is mono-Ruin (NOT in Crucible's accessible pool)
- Deepvault Keeper IS mono-Stone (accessible)
- Grim Reclaimer IS mono-Ember (accessible -- abandon ally: reclaim Warrior)
- Speaker for the Forgotten IS mono-Stone (accessible -- play Warrior: reclaim random cost 3 or less)

So Crucible has Warrior recursion through Grim Reclaimer and Speaker for the Forgotten, which is adequate. But the most exciting recursion pieces (Risen Champion's "dissolved: reclaim different Warrior" chain) require Ruin access that Crucible does not have. This is intentional -- it is the Bedrock archetype's territory -- but it means Crucible's late-game resilience depends on cards that were partially designed for it but are outside its pool.

**Severity: Medium.** Crucible's lack of resilience to board wipes remains its primary structural weakness. Grim Reclaimer helps but costs an abandon; Speaker for the Forgotten helps but is expensive (5 cost). A Crucible deck that gets hit by Apocalypse has limited recovery options compared to other archetypes. This is a feature, not a bug -- Crucible is the aggro archetype and should have a weaker late game -- but it is worth noting.

### Problem 4: Ember sacrifice cards are awkwardly positioned

Many of Crucible's Ember cards are sacrifice-themed (The Dread Sovereign, Forsworn Champion, Dreadcall Warden, Blade of Oblivion). These cards want you to abandon your own allies, which directly conflicts with:
- Blade of Unity (wants maximum ally count)
- Skyflame Commander (wants maximum Warrior count for lord value)
- Ironbark Warden (wants allies to stay in play across turns)
- Everhold Protector (wants persistence)

This tension is GOOD at the archetype level (sacrifice vs. board presence is an interesting decision), but it means that Crucible's Ember cards are not all pulling in the same direction. A drafter who loads up on sacrifice payoffs AND lord effects will find them working against each other.

**Severity: Low.** This is the Crucible-Cinder axis working as intended. The sacrifice cards are "Cinder-leaning Crucible" and the lord cards are "pure Crucible." The tension creates the archetype differentiation that was requested. Not a problem -- a feature.

### Problem 5: No fast-speed interaction in the Stone half

Crucible has zero fast events or fast characters in its Stone cards (Surge of Fury is a regular event). All of Crucible's reactive plays come from Ember (Immolate, Shatter the Frail, Pyrokinetic Surge, Fell the Mighty, Ride of the Vanguard) or Neutral (Return to Nowhere, Break the Sequence, Dreamscatter). This means Crucible's reactive capability is entirely dependent on the Ember half of its pool.

**Severity: Very Low.** Crucible is a proactive aggro archetype and does not need extensive reactive tools. The Ember removal suite is deep enough. This is an observation, not a problem.

---

## Summary

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Core Depth | 8/10 |
| Signpost Quality | 9/10 |
| Mechanical Coherence | 7/10 |
| Draft Signal Clarity | 8/10 |
| Deckbuilding Flexibility | 6/10 |
| **Composite** | **7.6/10** |

**Overall verdict:** Crucible is a well-designed tribal aggro archetype that has been meaningfully improved by v2. The critical v1 problem (9/10 on-rails) has been addressed through non-Warrior power pieces that create genuine purity-vs-power draft decisions. The archetype remains somewhat linear (this is inherent to Warrior tribal), but the two distinct builds (pure phalanx vs. Judgment engine) provide enough variation for replay value. Forgeborn Martyr is one of the better signpost designs in the format. The new Stone cards (Ironveil Watcher, Kindlespark Harvester, Ironbark Warden) are individually well-designed and collectively give Crucible strategic depth that it previously lacked.

**Rail score: 6/10** (down from v1's 9/10). This is the correct range for a tribal archetype -- less flexible than non-tribal archetypes, but no longer "every draft produces the same deck."
