# Tide Advocate — Final Revised Archetype Assessments

## Post-Discussion Summary

After four rounds of discussion with each resonance advocate (Zephyr, Stone, Ruin — 4 messages each; Ember — 4 messages sent, no responses received), here are my final assessments incorporating the proposals made, trades accepted, and agreements reached.

---

## Tempest (Tide+Ember) — A- (8.2/10) → Revised: A- (8.1/10, slight downgrade)

### What's Working
- **Stormtide Oracle** is a top-3 signpost in the format. Cumulative void-event scaling successfully addresses the v1 "homogeneous event-count trigger" problem. The tension between recovering events (shrinking spark) and keeping them in void (growing spark) creates genuine gameplay decisions.
- **Two distinct builds** now exist: Big Storm (burst combo) and Slow Burn (reactive control with growing Oracle). This is a major v2 improvement — v1 had essentially one build path.
- **Archivist of Vanished Names** is one of the best-designed new cards in the set. Named-type tutoring + incidental milling creates different evaluations by archetype. Both audits praised it highly.
- **Duskwatch Vigil** bridges Tide's reactive Prevent identity with Tempest's proactive storm plan. "Prevent → next event costs 2 less" converts dead defensive cards into storm fuel. This is the card that makes the Slow Burn build viable.
- **Core depth at 9/10** — the deepest event engine in the format with redundant pieces at every role.

### What's Not Working
- **Starcatcher contradiction (RESOLUTION AGREED).** Starcatcher moved from Ember to Stone, removing Tempest's event-triggered energy generation. Stone advocate has agreed in principle to re-tag Starcatcher from "Tempest, Basalt" to "Depths, Basalt" — acknowledging the loss honestly rather than hiding it behind a misleading tag. I've proposed to the Ember advocate that Soulbinder be modified to include "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" as a secondary trigger, filling the Starcatcher-shaped hole without adding a new card. **Ember advocate has not responded** to any of 4 messages — the Soulbinder modification remains unconfirmed.
- **No new events in v2 batch.** All 25 new cards are characters. Tempest is fundamentally an event archetype, so it received no new tools in its primary card type. Stormtide Oracle is a character that cares about events, which partially compensates.
- **Ember pool dilution.** ~15 of 45 Ember cards are Cinder-specific abandon/sacrifice that are dead for Tempest. The effective Ember pool is closer to 30 playable cards. This is structural and creates healthy draft skill, but it does mean Tempest navigates more "noise" than most archetypes.

### Revised Grade Rationale
Slight downgrade from 8.2 to 8.1 to reflect the Starcatcher loss being more impactful than initially assessed. The storm engine's self-sustaining capability is reduced without event-triggered energy generation. Keeper of the Lightpath (events cost 1 less) partially compensates but from the cost-reduction side, not the energy-generation side. The Starcatcher re-tag to "Depths, Basalt" is agreed — this loss is now honestly acknowledged rather than hidden behind a misleading tag.

### Proposed Changes (Status)
1. Re-tag Starcatcher from "Tempest, Basalt" to "Depths, Basalt" — **AGREED** (Stone advocate confirmed)
2. Modify Soulbinder to add "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" — **PENDING** (Ember advocate unresponsive)
3. If future card budget exists: add 1 new Ember event for Tempest — **DEFERRED**

## Mirage (Tide+Zephyr) — A- (8.2/10) → Revised: A- (8.2/10, unchanged)

### What's Working
- **Tideweaver Adept** is one of the strongest signpost designs in the set. Modal (draw 2 OR bounce + gain 2 energy) creates genuine game-state-dependent decisions. Multi-archetype reach to Basalt and Depths as secondary users.
- **Mechanical coherence at 9/10** — the tightest engine in the format. Flicker → Materialized → card/energy/spark advantage → fund more flickers. Every piece feeds the cycle.
- **~25-card mechanical core** spanning enablers (Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer, Dimensional Pathfinder), targets (Frost Visionary, Aurora Channeler, Keeper of Forgotten Light), and payoffs (Starlit Cascade, The Bondweaver, Nexus of Passing). The depth is exceptional.
- **Two distinct builds**: Tempo Flicker (low-curve, cheap targets, incremental spark) and Engine Flicker (high-curve, Aurora Rider mass flicker, Conduit of Resonance cascades). Real draft variety.
- **Hidden gems reward format mastery**: Radiant Trio (3 figments = 3 Bondweaver triggers + draw + energy), Moonlit Dancer (fast for all characters in hand = reactive flicker), Conduit of Resonance (materialize = all Judgment abilities fire = cascade chains).

### What's Not Working
- **Removal dependency on neutral pool.** Zero in-color hard removal. Must compete with every archetype for Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration. Bounce effects (Abyssal Enforcer, Return to Nowhere) are pseudo-removal but can't answer high-spark persistent threats.
- **Pallid Arbiter vulnerability.** Ironically in Mirage's own pool but shuts down the entire engine. Opponents running Pallid Arbiter (any Tide archetype) negate all Materialized triggers. Mirage must prioritize drafting neutral removal to answer this.
- **Spark ceiling concern.** Individual creatures are mostly 1-2 spark. Without Nexus of Passing or Aurora Rider as finishers, closing games against Crucible's Blade of Unity or Basalt's Spirit Bond is difficult.
- **Basalt signal overlap.** Both Mirage and Basalt care about materialize triggers. The Bondweaver and Lumin-Gate Seer serve both equally, creating signal confusion in packs 1-2. I raised this with the Zephyr advocate.

### Revised Grade Rationale
No change. Mirage is healthy and the v2 changes serve it well. The removal dependency and Pallid Arbiter vulnerability are structural features that create counterplay rather than design flaws. The archetype rewards draft skill (knowing when to take neutral removal over another synergy piece) and gameplay skill (protecting the engine from hate cards).

### Proposed Changes
None. Mirage is in excellent shape. With Dreamtide Cartographer now moving to Zephyr (agreed by all parties), Mirage gains access to it through its Zephyr half — a small bonus for an already-healthy archetype. Additionally, Keeper of Forgotten Light is confirmed as a dual Depths/Mirage piece, further reinforcing Mirage's Tide half.

## Undertow (Tide+Ruin) — A- (8.2/10) → Revised: A- (8.2/10, unchanged)

### What's Working
- **Abyssal Reclaimer** is a well-designed conditional signpost. "If a card entered your void from another source this turn" is elegant — easy to meet in-archetype (Flagbearer of Decay, other Survivors fire first) but genuinely conditional for out-of-archetype drafters.
- **Tidechannel Observer** is one of the most important mechanical innovations in the set. "If 3+ cards entered your void this turn, gain 2 pts + kindle 1" cleanly differentiates Undertow (trivially hits 3/turn from mill) from Bedrock (almost never hits 3/turn). This creates format-level mechanical identity.
- **Core depth at 9/10** with multiple redundant mill sources (Searcher in the Mists, Flagbearer of Decay, Harvest the Forgotten, Ashborn Necromancer, Archivist of Vanished Names, Voidthorn Protector, Abyssal Reclaimer). Losing 2-3 mill cards in draft does not collapse the engine.
- **20 Survivors accessible** through Ruin (19) + Abyssal Reclaimer (dual). Plus Boundless Wanderer (neutral, all types). Tribal density is excellent.
- **Two distinct builds**: Survivor Swarm (tribal aggro-midrange with Soulkindler anthem) and Void Engine (control-combo with Architect of Memory enabling universal Reclaim). Minimal card overlap between builds.
- **Voidthorn Protector** (new) is a creative design: a Prevent in Ruin via self-sacrifice cost, bridging Depths (Prevent suite) and Undertow (Survivor tribal + void-filling rider).

### What's Not Working
- **Soulkindler is a single point of failure.** The sole passive void-based anthem. Without it, Survivor Swarm's 1-spark bodies can't compete on points. I proposed to the Ruin advocate that a second, weaker void anthem ("While in void, Survivors +1 spark") could provide redundancy, but Ruin is at 45 (ceiling) making additions difficult.
- **Void-banish vulnerability.** Soulflame Predator (Zephyr, "Materialized: Banish opponent's void") is catastrophic — one activation deletes Soulkindler's anthem, Architect of Memory's threshold, Abomination of Memory's spark, and all Reclaim targets. I raised this with both the Zephyr and Ruin advocates. The counterplay exists (Prevent Soulflame Predator with Tide's suite), but it's binary — either you counter it or you lose.
- **Ruin shared by 4 archetypes** creates draft signal noise. Three pinch-point cards (Architect of Memory, Path to Redemption, Reclaimer of Lost Paths) are contested by all Ruin archetypes. Undertow-specific cards (mill, Survivor tribal) signal cleanly, but the shared infrastructure does not.
- **Ashlight Caller tag error.** Listed with "Tempest" as a primary archetype, but it's mono-Ruin — Tempest (Tide+Ember) cannot access it. Tag should read "Undertow" only. I flagged this with the Ruin advocate.

### Revised Grade Rationale
No change. Undertow is one of the strongest archetypes in the format. The Soulkindler dependency is a moderate concern but the archetype has enough depth to function without it (Void Engine build doesn't need Soulkindler). The void-banish vulnerability is healthy counterplay, not a design flaw.

### Proposed Changes (Status)
1. Clean up Ashlight Caller archetype tags (remove "Tempest," which can't access mono-Ruin) — **AGREED** (Ruin advocate confirmed)
2. Clean up Voidthorn Protector tags (remove "Gale," which can't access mono-Ruin) — **AGREED** (Ruin advocate confirmed)
3. Broaden Ruin infrastructure tags: add Bedrock to Searcher in the Mists, Flagbearer of Decay — **PROPOSED** (awaiting confirmation)
4. If Ruin ever has room: add a secondary void anthem for Survivor Swarm redundancy — **DEFERRED** (Ruin at ceiling, accepted as status quo)

## Depths (Tide+Stone) — B- (7.0/10) → Revised: B (7.2/10, conditional upgrade)

### What's Working
- **Watcher of the Fathoms** resolves the critical v1 signpost problem. The hand-size-gated kindle (5+ cards = kindle 2) rewards Tide's natural card accumulation. The Prevent-trigger energy refund (Prevent = gain 2 energy) converts reactive denial into proactive investment, solving the classic control tempo problem. This is one of the better-designed signposts in the set.
- **Duskwatch Vigil** creates a Prevent-to-discount loop that is transformative for Depths. "When you prevent, next event costs 2 less" lets Depths play Prevent-then-develop in the same turn cycle, addressing the tempo problem of reactive control.
- **Everhold Protector** creates a ticking kindle clock that, behind Prevent protection, accumulates significant value. The "since your last turn" check creates anti-synergy with Zephyr flicker (good resonance separation).
- **Ironbark Warden** pumps persistent bodies — perfect for a control deck that protects creatures over multiple turns.
- **Kindlespark Harvester** introduces "spark as spendable resource" — a novel mechanic that converts accumulated kindle into removal. Excellent for a control deck with surplus spark.
- **Two builds exist**: Fortress Control (Prevent-heavy, kindle accumulation, soft-lock with Cloaked Sentinel) and Midrange Value (body-centric with light Prevents, board-presence scoring).

### What's Not Working
- **Stone pool dilution remains the core problem.** Of Stone's 40 cards, ~18-20 are Warrior or Spirit Animal tribal with zero Depths synergy. Effective Stone pool for Depths is closer to 20 cards, not 40. This cannot be fully fixed without restructuring Stone's tribal distribution, which would break Crucible and Basalt.
- **Every new Stone card is shared with Crucible.** Everhold Protector (Depths, Crucible), Ironbark Warden (Crucible, Depths), Kindlespark Harvester (Crucible, Cinder, Depths). In draft, Crucible will snap these up first due to better Warrior synergy. Depths gets what Crucible doesn't want.
- **Lowest accessible pool at 105.** 3 fewer than Mirage/Basalt (108), 10 fewer than Cinder (115). The effective pool after removing tribal noise is closer to 75-80.
- **No event-based removal.** Entirely dependent on neutral pool for dissolve effects. Every archetype competes for Scorched Reckoning, Abyssal Plunge, Burst of Obliteration.
- **Draft signal clarity at 6/10** — the worst in the format. Hard to distinguish "Stone is open" from "Crucible/Basalt just aren't being drafted."
- **Win condition speed.** Kindle accumulation is inherently slow. Against Gale or Cinder that score 15+ by turn 4-5, Depths may not have time.

### Upgrade Rationale
Upgrading from 7.0 to 7.2 based on agreements reached in council:
1. **Starcatcher re-tagged to "Depths, Basalt"** — **AGREED** by Stone advocate. This gives Depths a 4-cost event-energy body that synergizes with its event-heavy control plan (Prevent events each generate 1 energy). Zero-cost fix that meaningfully improves Depths's Stone half.
2. **Dreamtide Cartographer accepted as moving to Zephyr.** Depths loses a hidden gem but gains Starcatcher as partial compensation. The Duskwatch Vigil + Watcher of the Fathoms combo (identified jointly with Stone advocate) is the real Depths engine — Cartographer was supplementary. Mirage regains Cartographer access through its Zephyr half.
3. **New Depths-primary Stone card proposed** — "Sentinel of Still Waters" (refined in discussion with Stone advocate to also serve Bedrock). Design: 3-cost, 1-spark, "When you prevent a card or an opponent's character leaves play, gain 2 energy" + "Judgment: If 5+ cards in hand, kindle 2." Rewards reactive play patterns that Crucible actively avoids while also bridging to Bedrock's void-play identity. Stone at 40 can go to 41 within the 38-45 range. **PROPOSED**, pending Stone advocate's final confirmation on the specific design.
4. **Tag cleanup** — all inaccessible tags agreed for removal. This disproportionately helps Depths (lowest signal clarity at 6/10).

The upgrade is now primarily contingent on the new Stone card being accepted. Without it, Depths rises to ~7.1 (Starcatcher re-tag alone). With it, the solid B at 7.2 is justified.

### Proposed Changes (Status)
1. **Re-tag Starcatcher** from "Tempest, Basalt" to "Depths, Basalt" — **AGREED**
2. **Accept Dreamtide Cartographer moving to Zephyr** — **AGREED** (Tide 40→39, Zephyr 43→44, both in range)
3. **Add 1 Depths-primary Stone card** ("Sentinel of Still Waters") — **PROPOSED**, Stone 40→41
4. **Clean up tags:** Remove Gale from Duskwatch Vigil's primary archetype list — **AGREED**

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### Issue 1: Inaccessible Archetype Tags (Format-Wide)

Multiple cards list primary archetypes that cannot actually draft them. This is misleading for draft analysis and should be cleaned up regardless of other changes:

| Card | Current Tag | Problem | Fix |
|------|------------|---------|-----|
| Starcatcher | Tempest, Basalt | Tempest can't access Stone | Depths, Basalt |
| Duskwatch Vigil | Depths, Gale, Tempest | Gale can't access Tide | Depths, Tempest |
| Voidthorn Protector | Depths, Gale, Cinder | Gale can't access Ruin | Depths, Cinder |
| Dreamtide Cartographer | Gale, Tempest, Eclipse | Gale/Eclipse can't access Tide | If stays Tide: Tempest, Depths. If moves to Zephyr: Gale, Eclipse, Mirage |
| Ashlight Caller | Tempest, Undertow | Tempest can't access Ruin | Undertow (primary), Eclipse, Bedrock |
| Ashen Threshold | Mirage, Cinder, Bedrock | Bedrock can't access Ember | Mirage, Cinder, Gale |

This is a zero-cost fix that improves the accuracy of the allocation document.

### Issue 2: The Dreamtide Cartographer Trade — ACCEPTED

**Agreement reached with Zephyr, Stone, and Ruin advocates.** Move Dreamtide Cartographer from mono-Tide to mono-Zephyr.

**Conditions met or in progress:**
- Starcatcher re-tagged to "Depths, Basalt" — **AGREED**
- Zephyr advocate supports Depths compensation — **CONFIRMED**
- All inaccessible tags cleaned up — **AGREED** by all responding advocates

**Impact analysis:**
- Tide: 40 → 39 (still within range)
- Zephyr: 43 → 44 (still within range)
- Gale gains access (HIGH priority fix — resolved)
- Eclipse gains access (MEDIUM priority fix — resolved)
- Tempest/Undertow lose access (absorbable — both at A- with 9/10 core depth)
- Depths loses access (compensated by Starcatcher re-tag + proposed new Stone card)
- Mirage gains access through Zephyr half (net positive for an already-healthy archetype)

### Issue 3: The Starcatcher Resolution — PARTIALLY RESOLVED

Three options discussed with advocates:
1. **Re-tag only** (minimum): "Tempest, Basalt" → "Depths, Basalt" — **AGREED by Stone advocate**
2. **Re-tag + Soulbinder modification**: Add "When you play an event, gain 1 energy" to Soulbinder — **PENDING** (Ember advocate unresponsive after 4 messages)
3. **Re-tag + new Ember card**: Create a new mono-Ember event-energy card — **DEFERRED**

Option 1 is confirmed. Option 2 remains my preferred path but requires Ember advocate engagement. The Starcatcher re-tag alone is a meaningful improvement — it honestly acknowledges the Tempest loss and simultaneously strengthens Depths.

### Issue 4: Ember Advocate Non-Response

The Ember advocate has not responded to any of 4 messages sent across the council session. Outstanding Ember-related items:
- Soulbinder modification for Tempest (event-triggered energy generation)
- Ashen Threshold tag cleanup (remove "Bedrock," add "Gale")
- General alignment on Tempest's Ember half

These items remain unresolved through no fault of the Tide advocate's engagement. I recommend the team lead follow up directly with the Ember advocate.

## Final Summary

| Archetype | V2 Grade | Revised Grade | Trend | Key Action Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Tempest | A- (8.2) | A- (8.1) | Slight ↓ | Soulbinder modification | PENDING (Ember unresponsive) |
| Mirage | A- (8.2) | A- (8.2) | Stable | None | COMPLETE |
| Undertow | A- (8.2) | A- (8.2) | Stable | Tag cleanup only | AGREED |
| Depths | B- (7.0) | B (7.2)* | ↑ conditional | Starcatcher re-tag + new Stone card | *Re-tag AGREED; new card PROPOSED |

### Agreements Reached This Council Session

| # | Item | Parties | Status |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Starcatcher re-tag "Tempest, Basalt" → "Depths, Basalt" | Tide + Stone | AGREED |
| 2 | Dreamtide Cartographer move Tide → Zephyr | Tide + Zephyr + Stone + Ruin | AGREED |
| 3 | Cartographer new tags: "Gale, Eclipse, Mirage" | Tide + Zephyr | AGREED |
| 4 | Remove "Gale" from Duskwatch Vigil | Tide + Zephyr + Ruin | AGREED |
| 5 | Remove "Gale" from Voidthorn Protector | Tide + Zephyr + Ruin | AGREED |
| 6 | Remove "Tempest" from Ashlight Caller | Tide + Ruin | AGREED |
| 7 | Remove "Bedrock" from Ashen Threshold | Tide + Zephyr + Ruin | AGREED |
| 8 | Pallid Arbiter as deliberate anti-Mirage design | Tide + Zephyr | CONFIRMED |
| 9 | Archivist of Vanished Names stays untouched | All responding advocates | CONFIRMED |
| 10 | New Depths-primary Stone card ("Sentinel of Still Waters") | Tide + Stone (proposed) | PROPOSED |
| 11 | Soulbinder modification for Tempest | Tide + Ember (proposed) | PENDING |

### Outstanding Items Requiring Follow-Up

1. **Ember advocate non-response.** 4 messages sent, 0 responses received. Soulbinder modification and Ashen Threshold tag cleanup remain unresolved.
2. **"Sentinel of Still Waters" design finalization.** Stone advocate has engaged constructively on Depths needs but hasn't given final confirmation on the specific card design.
3. **Broader Ruin tag proposals.** Adding Bedrock to Searcher in the Mists and Flagbearer of Decay — proposed but awaiting confirmation.

**Tide resonance overall: Healthy.** Three of four archetypes are A-tier. The urgent work — bringing Depths from B- to a solid B — has made real progress through the Starcatcher re-tag and Cartographer trade agreements. The remaining gap is the proposed new Stone card, which would close the Depths upgrade to a firm 7.2.

The v2 redesign has been a success for the Tide resonance. The council session produced 7 confirmed agreements and 3 pending proposals. The remaining work is incremental refinement, not structural repair.
