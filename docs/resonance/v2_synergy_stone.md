# Stone Synergy Discovery Report -- Hidden Vectors & Cross-Resonance Bridges

## Preamble

This report does not describe what Stone IS (the stone.md identity document already does that). Instead it describes what Stone COULD synergize with -- the latent game-state conditions that Stone's mechanics produce as side effects, and the cross-resonance opportunities that would open up if the right connector cards existed. The goal is to identify 8-12 hidden synergy vectors that could justify new Stone cards (addressing the known 31 vs ~40 deficit) without diluting Stone's identity.

---

## 1. Side Effect Inventory

Stone's five mechanical themes create game-state conditions that are currently incidental, not exploited. Each side effect is a potential synergy anchor.

### SE-1: Energy Surplus in Late Turns
Stone's Judgment-phase ramp (Dawnblade Wanderer, Ethereal Trailblazer, Emerald Guardian, Ghostlight Wolves, Spirit of the Greenwood, Luminwings) and end-of-turn ramp (Virtuoso of Harmony) compound over multiple turns. By turn 4-5, a Stone deck frequently has 3-6 MORE energy than the opponent per turn. This surplus often exceeds what the deck can efficiently deploy, creating "energy waste" -- unspent energy at end of turn.

**Current exploitation:** Hard-casting expensive finishers, activated abilities (Assault Leader, Spiritbound Alpha, Mystic Runefish).
**Unexploited:** The surplus itself as a resource for scaling effects, energy-threshold triggers, or energy-conversion engines.

### SE-2: High Character Count / Board Width
Stone characters persist. They do not self-sacrifice (Ember), do not bounce to hand (Zephyr), do not dissolve for void value (Ruin). Combined with cheap creatures (Ethereal Trailblazer 0-cost, Wolfbond Chieftain 0-cost, Aspiring Guardian 0-cost, Ebonwing 1-cost, Driftcaller Sovereign 1-cost), Stone frequently fields 4-6 characters simultaneously by the midgame.

**Current exploitation:** Warrior tribal density (lords scale linearly with count), Spirit of the Greenwood (energy per ally).
**Unexploited:** Board-width thresholds as gating conditions, "number of allies" as a scaling variable for non-tribal effects, board-presence-gated abilities.

### SE-3: Predictable Leftmost Character
Kindle accumulates on the leftmost character. Stone's Kindle-on-Judgment effects (Ebonwing, Spirit Field Reclaimer) and general Kindle in the ecosystem create a single high-spark character on the leftmost position while the rest of the board is modest. This creates a predictable "tall+wide" board shape: one 4-6 spark character flanked by several 0-2 spark characters.

**Current exploitation:** Raw spark points from the leftmost character.
**Unexploited:** The spark differential between leftmost and other characters, the existence of a single "tallest" character as a targeting condition, Kindle as an exponential rather than linear resource.

### SE-4: Multiple Judgment Triggers Per Turn Cycle
A Stone board with 3-4 characters that each have Judgment abilities fires 3-4 triggers every Judgment phase. With Surge of Fury or Conduit of Resonance, this can spike to 6-8+ triggers per turn. The VOLUME of Judgment events is unusually high.

**Current exploitation:** Individual trigger effects (energy, kindle, draw).
**Unexploited:** Judgment-count-matters payoffs, Judgment-trigger chaining, "whenever a Judgment ability triggers" as a triggerable condition.

### SE-5: Cost Reduction Creates Effective Zero-Cost Plays
Nexus Wayfinder (characters cost 2 less) combined with natural ramp can make 3-4 cost characters effectively free. This creates turns where Stone deploys 2-3 characters with energy left over. The combination of cost reduction + energy surplus creates turns with very high "action density" -- many plays in a single turn -- that Stone currently doesn't benefit from.

**Current exploitation:** Raw deployment speed.
**Unexploited:** "Cards played this turn" synergies are currently Tempest's territory, but Stone achieves this condition through a completely different mechanism (cost reduction + ramp vs. cheap events + burst energy).

### SE-6: Warrior Subtype Density Creates Reliable Tribal Counts
At 4+ Warriors on board (common in Crucible), tribal scaling effects become very predictable. Blade of Unity is reliably a 4/5 spark body. Fury of the Clan reliably kills anything under 4 cost. This reliability means Stone can plan around specific power thresholds -- something other resonances cannot do.

**Current exploitation:** Direct tribal scaling.
**Unexploited:** Threshold-based triggers that activate at specific Warrior counts, "graduated" tribal bonuses at milestones (2, 4, 6 Warriors).

### SE-7: Static Effects Accumulate Multiplicatively
Stone's static-effect characters (Skyflame Commander's +1 spark, Nexus Wayfinder's -2 cost, Cloaked Sentinel's +1 opponent event cost) stack multiplicatively when multiple are on the board. Two Skyflame Commanders is +2 spark to all Warriors; that's not just double the value, it's double for EACH Warrior. This multiplicative stacking is a unique Stone property because only Stone keeps multiple static-effect bodies alive simultaneously.

**Current exploitation:** Implicit in lord stacking.
**Unexploited:** Static effects that interact with EACH OTHER rather than just stacking. Cross-referencing static abilities.

### SE-8: Judgment Phase as a Predictable Timing Window
Stone's heavy investment in Judgment-phase triggers means Stone always has a critical mass of activity during Judgment. This makes the Judgment phase a reliable "event" that other cards could key off of. Other resonances have Judgment cards (The Calling Night, Flickerveil Adept, Blooming Path Wanderer), but only Stone can guarantee Judgment is always a high-impact phase.

**Current exploitation:** Individual Judgment triggers.
**Unexploited:** Judgment phase as a macro-event that other effects could amplify, redirect, or transform.

## 2. Cross-Resonance Bridge Opportunities

Cards in OTHER resonances that would become surprisingly strong in Stone archetypes with the right connector.

### Bridge 2A: Conduit of Resonance / Blazing Emberwing (Zephyr) in Depths
**Current home:** Basalt core.
**Stone connection:** Both convert materializations into Judgment triggers. Depths plays expensive characters from hand with ramp energy. Each deployment triggers all Judgment abilities on existing board. Currently Depths has no reason to run these because Depths doesn't have enough Judgment-trigger creatures (only 2-3 vs Basalt's 6+). A new Stone creature with both a Judgment trigger and a control-relevant static effect would make Conduit/Blazing Emberwing viable in Depths.

### Bridge 2B: Illumination of Glory / Echoes of the Journey (Tempest) in Stone Ramp
**Current home:** Tempest core.
**Stone connection:** "Gain points/draw for each card played this turn." Stone with Nexus Wayfinder + ramp can play 3-4 characters in a single turn (see SE-5). This is comparable to Tempest's event chains. A connector card that counts character plays specifically (rather than all cards) would bridge Stone's deployment density to these payoff effects without stepping on Tempest's event identity.

### Bridge 2C: Silent Avenger / Seer of the Fallen (Ruin/Undertow) in Crucible
**Current home:** Undertow core (Survivor tribal).
**Stone connection:** Both trigger when an allied Survivor is dissolved. Crucible plays creatures that persist; the opponent's removal dissolving them IS the trigger. Crucible doesn't run Survivors naturally, but if a dual Stone+Ruin Warrior-Survivor hybrid existed (or a Warrior with "Dissolved: trigger" existed), these Undertow bridge cards become Crucible-relevant. Currently, Spirit Field Reclaimer and Twilight Suppressor are Warriors in Depths, but neither has Dissolved triggers.

### Bridge 2D: Starlit Cascade (Tide/Mirage) in Crucible
**Current home:** Mirage core.
**Stone connection:** "When an ally leaves play, gain 2 energy." In Crucible, the opponent is incentivized to remove your Warriors. Each successful removal becomes an energy refund. Currently Crucible doesn't benefit from its own creatures dying. A connector card that reads "When an allied Warrior is dissolved by the opponent, [effect]" would turn Crucible's board durability narrative into a win-win: either your Warriors persist and generate Judgment value, OR they die and fuel recovery.

### Bridge 2E: Scrap Reclaimer (Ruin) in Crucible/Bedrock
**Current home:** Bedrock flex / Eclipse flex.
**Stone connection:** "Judgment: Return this character from your void to your hand." This is one of the few Ruin cards that uses Judgment as a timing mechanism. In a Stone ramp deck, you have the energy to re-deploy Scrap Reclaimer every turn from hand after it self-reclaims. It becomes an unkillable 4-cost body. Currently no archetype exploits this "Judgment recursion" loop because no deck has both Judgment focus AND void interaction. Bedrock comes closest but prioritizes cheating expensive bodies, not grinding with a 0-spark 4-cost.

### Bridge 2F: Boundless Wanderer (Neutral) in Crucible
**Current home:** Neutral filler.
**Stone connection:** "Judgment: With 3 allies sharing a type, draw 1." Warriors are the easiest subtype to reach 3+ density. In Crucible, Boundless Wanderer is a guaranteed Judgment draw engine because it has all subtypes AND Crucible has Warrior density. This is already theoretically available but under-documented as a Crucible synergy.

## 3. Hidden Synergy Vectors

### Vector 1: "Energy Overflow" -- Converting Excess Energy into Points or Spark
**Condition:** Stone frequently has 2-4 unspent energy at end of turn by midgame (SE-1).
**Bridges:** Stone alone, or Stone+Tide (Depths).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "End of turn: Gain 1 point for every 3 unspent energy" or "Judgment: If you have 6 or more energy, kindle 2." This converts the energy surplus into win-condition pressure without requiring the player to find something to spend energy on.
**Non-obviousness:** 7/10. Energy ramp decks in card games often suffer from "flooding out" -- having more resources than things to spend them on. Currently Stone mitigates this with expensive finishers, but an energy-threshold payoff would address the problem structurally rather than requiring specific top-end draws.
**Stone identity fit:** Strong. Patient accumulation rewarded. Does not sacrifice, does not interact with void, does not react.

### Vector 2: "Judgment Storm" -- Counting Judgment Triggers for Scaling Effects
**Condition:** Stone boards fire 3-6 Judgment triggers per phase (SE-4). With Surge of Fury, this doubles.
**Bridges:** Stone+Zephyr (Basalt) primarily, Stone alone secondarily.
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Judgment: Gain 1 point for each other Judgment ability that triggered this phase" or "At end of Judgment, kindle equal to the number of Judgment abilities that triggered this turn." This creates a Judgment-count-matters payoff that rewards the wide Judgment board Stone builds naturally.
**Non-obviousness:** 8/10. Judgment triggers are currently independent -- each fires in isolation. Treating the Judgment phase as a holistic event where the total count matters is a novel axis. Surge of Fury is the only card that cares about the Judgment phase as a whole, and it's an event, not a permanent.
**Stone identity fit:** Excellent. This is literally "patience rewarded" -- you invested in Judgment infrastructure over many turns, and now the count of Judgment triggers itself becomes a resource.

### Vector 3: "The Formation's Shield" -- Board Width as a Defensive Resource
**Condition:** Stone reliably fields 4-6 characters (SE-2). The board itself could be a defensive resource.
**Bridges:** Stone+Tide (Depths), Stone alone.
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character or event with "Your characters cannot be dissolved while you control 4 or more allies" or more subtly "When an enemy targets an ally, if you control 4+ allies, prevent that effect unless the opponent pays 2 energy." This turns board width into a protection mechanism -- a "formation bonus" that rewards Stone's commitment to the board.
**Non-obviousness:** 6/10. Board-width protection is a recognizable MTG concept (hexproof by committee), but Dreamtides has no existing card that creates a defensive threshold from board count. It would differentiate Stone's durability from Tide's reactive Prevent.
**Stone identity fit:** Strong. "I am too large for you to overcome" (from the identity doc). This is proactive inevitability, not reactive denial.

### Vector 4: "Kindle Conversion" -- Using the Tall Leftmost Character for Non-Spark Effects
**Condition:** Kindle creates one very high-spark leftmost character (SE-3). That spark is only used for scoring.
**Bridges:** Stone+Ember (Crucible), Stone alone.
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Activate: Remove 3 spark from your leftmost ally: Dissolve an enemy with cost 3 or less" or "The leftmost ally's spark counts as energy for activated abilities." This converts the Kindle investment from a purely scoring resource into a flexible resource that enables removal or other effects.
**Non-obviousness:** 8/10. Kindle is currently a one-dimensional mechanic -- it adds spark, spark scores points. Converting accumulated spark into a non-scoring effect (removal, energy, protection) creates interesting decisions: Do I score with my 6-spark leftmost character, or do I spend that spark for board control? This gives Stone a sacrifice-LIKE mechanic (spending accumulated resources) without actually abandoning characters.
**Stone identity fit:** Moderate-to-strong. The character stays in play; only the accumulated spark is spent. This is "spending your savings" rather than "destroying your assets." It does not violate Stone's anti-sacrifice principle because the body remains.

### Vector 5: "Ramp into Action Density" -- Cards-Played-This-Turn Payoffs via Cost Reduction
**Condition:** Nexus Wayfinder + energy surplus enables 3-4 plays per turn (SE-5), matching Tempest's storm count.
**Bridges:** Stone+Tide (Depths), Stone+Ember (Crucible).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Judgment: Gain 1 spark for each character you played this turn" or "When you play your 3rd card this turn, draw 2." This creates a "deployment storm" payoff that differs from Tempest's "event storm" by rewarding character deployment specifically. Stone achieves high action density through fundamentally different means (ramp + cost reduction) than Tempest (cheap events + burst energy), so the same "cards per turn" threshold produces a different deck texture.
**Non-obviousness:** 9/10. This is one of the most counterintuitive vectors because "cards played this turn" is perceived as Tempest's exclusive domain. But Stone reaches the same condition through a completely orthogonal mechanism. The key insight is that Stone's ramp investment over turns 1-3 compresses into a single explosive deployment turn on turns 4-5 -- a kind of "delayed storm" that is philosophically very different from Tempest's "immediate chain."
**Stone identity fit:** Good. Patient investment (ramp over many turns) exploding into a single impactful turn of deployments fits Stone's "investments that mature" philosophy. The payoff comes from characters, not events, preserving Stone's creature-centric identity.

### Vector 6: "Persistent Tax Effects" -- Static Stacking as Win Condition
**Condition:** Stone's static effects (Skyflame Commander, Nexus Wayfinder, Cloaked Sentinel) accumulate multiplicatively when multiple bodies coexist (SE-7).
**Bridges:** Stone+Tide (Depths) primarily.
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "The opponent's characters enter play with -1 spark" or "Characters the opponent plays cost 1 more." Currently, Cloaked Sentinel taxes EVENTS (+1 cost). A character tax on the opponent's CREATURES would be a new axis. With two such effects on board, the opponent's 3-cost 2-spark character becomes a 4-cost 1-spark character -- radically less efficient. This gives Depths a proactive "resource denial" wincon instead of relying on reactive Prevents.
**Non-obviousness:** 7/10. Individual tax effects are common in card games. The non-obvious element is that Stone is the only resonance that can STACK multiple tax effects simultaneously because Stone keeps its taxing bodies alive. A single tax effect is annoying; three stacked tax effects is game-ending. The synergy is emergent from board durability, not from any individual card.
**Stone identity fit:** Excellent. "I am too large for you to overcome" becomes "I am making everything you do insufficient." Proactive, permanent, non-interactive. The quintessence of Stone.

### Vector 7: "Warrior Death Dividends" -- Profiting When the Opponent Kills Your Warriors
**Condition:** Stone's durable Warriors incentivize the opponent to use removal. When they do, the investment is lost -- currently, Stone has NO payoff for its creatures dying (that's Ruin territory). But the INVESTMENT the opponent spent on removal is also wasted if Stone recovers.
**Bridges:** Stone+Ember (Crucible), potentially Stone+Ruin (Bedrock).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone Warrior with "When this character is dissolved by the opponent, each allied Warrior gains +1 spark" or a Stone event "Whenever an allied Warrior is dissolved this turn, gain 2 energy and kindle 1." This gives Crucible a resilience layer: the opponent can either leave Warriors alive (and watch them accumulate Judgment value) or kill them (and fuel Stone's recovery). This is NOT the same as Ruin's Dissolved triggers, which profit from ANY dissolution including self-sacrifice. Stone's version would specifically trigger on OPPONENT-caused dissolution, preserving Stone's anti-sacrifice stance.
**Non-obviousness:** 8/10. The distinction between "profit from death" (Ruin) and "punish the opponent for killing your stuff" (Stone) is subtle but philosophically critical. Ruin wants things to die. Stone wants things to live but makes killing them costly. The non-obvious insight: Stone's board durability is currently binary (alive = good, dead = bad). Making death costly to the OPPONENT creates a genuine dilemma.
**Stone identity fit:** Strong with careful scoping. The trigger MUST be opponent-caused dissolution only, not self-sacrifice. Stone says "you shouldn't have done that" rather than "I'm glad that died." Warbond Sentinel (the proposed Crucible signpost) already touches this design space with "When an allied Warrior is dissolved, gain 1 energy."

### Vector 8: "The Long Game Escalator" -- Turn-Count Scaling
**Condition:** Stone games go long by nature. The longer the game, the more Judgment triggers have fired, the more energy has been generated, the wider the board (SE-1, SE-2, SE-4, SE-8). But no card explicitly rewards "how long the game has gone."
**Bridges:** Stone alone, Stone+Tide (Depths).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Judgment: Put a counter on this character. Kindle equal to the number of counters" or "This character has +1 spark for each Judgment phase that has occurred while it was in play." This creates an explicitly time-scaling threat that embodies Stone's "patience rewarded" philosophy in its most literal form.
**Non-obviousness:** 5/10. "Gets bigger over time" is a straightforward design. The non-obvious element is that Stone currently lacks a SINGLE CARD that explicitly scales with game length. All of Stone's scaling is implicit (energy accumulation, board width, Kindle on leftmost). An explicit time-scaler would give Stone a "ticking clock" threat that forces the opponent to act.
**Stone identity fit:** Perfect. This is the purest possible expression of Stone's identity: "Does this card get better the longer it stays in play?" The answer is literally yes, by definition.

### Vector 9: "Judgment Ramp into Activated Abilities" -- Energy Generation Funding Permanent Effects
**Condition:** Stone generates energy during Judgment but can only spend it during the next Main Phase. Activated abilities that cost energy could be used DURING Judgment (if they had Judgment timing) or stockpiled for powerful Main Phase activations.
**Bridges:** Stone+Zephyr (Basalt), Stone alone.
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Judgment: You may pay 3 energy to give all allies +1 spark permanently" or a Stone Ancient with "6 energy activated ability: Kindle 3." These create energy sinks that convert surplus energy (SE-1) into permanent board improvement. Unlike Spiritbound Alpha (which costs 4 energy for temporary Spirit Animal spark), these would create PERMANENT value, fitting Stone's permanence theme.
**Non-obviousness:** 6/10. Energy sinks are standard game design. The non-obvious element is that Stone's current activated abilities are either tribal-gated (Spiritbound Alpha requires Spirit Animal density) or burst effects (Assault Leader for one turn). A non-tribal, permanent activated ability would give mono-Stone decks (not just Basalt or Crucible) something to do with excess energy.
**Stone identity fit:** Excellent. Spending patiently accumulated resources for permanent effects is deeply Stone.

### Vector 10: "Character Cost as Resource" -- Exploiting Stone's High-Cost Bodies
**Condition:** Stone plays the most expensive characters in the format (Keeper of Forgotten Light 6, The Waking Titan 5, Aurora Rider 6, Nexus Wayfinder 5). These high costs are a LIABILITY in other archetypes but an ASSET in Stone because Stone has the ramp to deploy them. Currently, cost is only relevant for deployment.
**Bridges:** Stone+Ruin (Bedrock), Stone+Tide (Depths).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "Allies with cost 4 or more have +1 spark" or "Judgment: If your total character cost on the battlefield is 12 or more, gain 3 energy." This makes the high cost of Stone's characters into a payoff rather than just a deployment hurdle. "I spent 20 total energy deploying my board" becomes a game-state condition that triggers bonuses.
**Non-obviousness:** 7/10. Cost-matters is explored in Dreamtides for removal targeting (Dissolve cost X or less, Banish cost X or less) but NOT for self-referential scaling. The idea that your own board's total mana investment becomes a resource is novel and fits Stone's "investment" metaphor perfectly.
**Stone identity fit:** Very strong. Stone is about investments maturing. Making total deployed cost a scaling variable rewards exactly the behavior Stone already incentivizes.

### Vector 11: "The Anchor Effect" -- Characters That Get Stronger by NOT Being Flickered/Bounced
**Condition:** Stone characters never leave play (anti-bounce, anti-flicker). Zephyr characters constantly cycle. A card that explicitly rewards continuous board presence (without leaving and re-entering) would be anti-Zephyr in a mechanically interesting way.
**Bridges:** Stone alone, anti-synergy with Zephyr (which is an enemy pair's tension expressed through a card).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone character with "At the start of your turn, if this character has been on the battlefield since your last turn, kindle 1" or "This character gains +1 spark for each consecutive turn it has been in play." The key is rewarding CONTINUOUS presence, which penalizes bouncing.
**Non-obviousness:** 7/10. "If this survived since last turn" is conceptually simple but mechanically unprecedented in Dreamtides. It creates tension with Zephyr's flicker (which would reset the counter) while rewarding Stone's permanence. The insight: Dreamtides has many "enters play" triggers (Materialized) but zero "stayed in play" rewards.
**Stone identity fit:** Perfect. This is board durability as its own reward.

### Vector 12: "Formation Positioning" -- Left/Right Board Position Matters
**Condition:** Kindle always targets the leftmost character (SE-3). This means Stone already implicitly cares about board positioning. But no card other than Kindle interacts with position.
**Bridges:** Stone alone, potentially Stone+Ember (Crucible).
**Connector card concept:** A Stone Warrior with "Allied Warriors to the right of this character have +1 spark" (a positional lord) or "Rightmost ally gains +1 spark at end of turn" (distributing growth away from leftmost). This creates a deckbuilding and play-ordering puzzle: which characters do you play first to set up optimal positions? It also creates interesting interaction with Kindle, which always goes left.
**Non-obviousness:** 9/10. Board positioning is a completely unexplored axis in Dreamtides. Kindle is the only position-aware mechanic. Extending position-awareness to other effects would create a uniquely Stone minigame that no other resonance accesses. The non-obvious insight: Stone's board persists long enough for position to matter. Zephyr's board constantly reshuffles; Ember's board is disposable. Only Stone has a stable enough board for positional effects to create meaningful decisions.
**Stone identity fit:** Excellent. Formations, stability, structure -- all core to Stone's "enduring foundation" identity. Positioning is a perfect mechanical expression of Stone's military/fortification theme.

---

## 4. Anti-Synergy Awareness -- What Stone Must NOT Do

### 4A: Stone Must Not Gain Void Interaction
Even to fill the card deficit, Stone should never print cards with Reclaim, void-size-matters, or Dissolved triggers as primary effects. These belong firmly to Ruin. The Bedrock archetype handles the Stone-Ruin bridge through SHARED cards that have Ruin resonance, not through Stone cards that touch the void.

**Exception:** Spirit Field Reclaimer's "banish cards from opponent's void" is acceptable because it is void HATE (disrupting the opponent's void), not void EXPLOITATION (profiting from your own void). More void-hate on Stone characters is acceptable; void-profit is not.

### 4B: Stone Must Not Gain Card Draw as Primary Effect
Card draw belongs to Tide. Stone may draw as a secondary rider (Invoker of Myths draws when you materialize a Warrior -- the primary effect is "tribal matters"), but a Stone card whose PRIMARY identity is "draw cards" violates the resonance boundary. The proposed Tidestone Arbiter (Depths signpost) with "Judgment: Draw 1" is borderline -- it's acceptable because the primary identity is "tax the opponent" and the draw is secondary.

### 4C: Stone Must Not Gain Fast-Speed Play
Stone is deliberately slow. No Stone card should have the Fast keyword. Ride of the Vanguard (Fast event, Warrior buff) is Ember-coded specifically because of Fast timing. Even if a hypothetical connector card would be great as Fast, it should be sorcery-speed if it's Stone.

### 4D: Stone Must Not Gain One-Shot Energy Burst
"Gain 6 energy" as an event is Ember (Flash of Power). Stone's energy comes in drips: 1-2 per turn per creature, compounding. A new Stone card should never generate more than 3 energy in a single trigger. The identity distinction: if you'd be happy drawing the card on turn 1 even though you can't use the energy yet, it might be Stone; if you need to use it immediately, it's Ember.

### 4E: Stone Must Not Gain Self-Sacrifice Payoffs
Even "When an allied Warrior is dissolved, gain X" needs careful scoping. Stone's version must trigger only on OPPONENT-caused dissolution, never on self-sacrifice. Cards like "Abandon a Warrior: gain 3 energy" are Ember. Cards like "When the opponent dissolves a Warrior you control: gain 3 energy" are potentially Stone. The distinction matters for Crucible's identity -- Crucible's Ember half handles sacrifice, Crucible's Stone half handles persistence.

### 4F: Stone Must Not Gain Bounce/Flicker
Even if "return an ally to hand" would synergize with Materialized triggers, bounce is Zephyr's territory. Stone's contribution to Basalt is economic (energy), not mechanical (movement). A Stone card should never return your own character to hand.

---

## 5. Card Deficit Recommendations

Stone has 31 mono cards vs a ~40 target, creating a 9-card deficit. The hidden synergy vectors above suggest the following categories of new cards that would fill the deficit without diluting Stone's identity:

### Category A: Energy Conversion (Vectors 1, 9)
2-3 new cards that convert surplus energy into non-deployment effects. These give Stone players something to do with excess energy beyond deploying more creatures.

### Category B: Judgment-Count Payoffs (Vector 2)
1-2 new cards that reward the volume of Judgment triggers. These synergize with Stone's existing Judgment infrastructure and scale with board width.

### Category C: Board-Width Rewards (Vectors 3, 6)
1-2 new cards that create threshold bonuses at 4+ allies. These reward Stone's persistent board without requiring Warrior subtype specifically.

### Category D: Permanence Rewards (Vectors 8, 11)
1-2 new cards that explicitly reward continuous board presence or game length. These are the purest expression of Stone's identity and have no precedent in the current card pool.

### Category E: Warrior Infrastructure (Vector 7)
1 new card that creates a "death tax" on opponents who remove Warriors, giving Crucible a resilience layer.

### Category F: Investment Scaling (Vector 10)
1 new card that converts total deployed cost into a bonus, rewarding Stone's expensive deployments.

|------|--------|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | V2 | Judgment Storm | 8/10 | Excellent | Opens a whole new axis for Stone scaling |
| 2 | V12 | Formation Positioning | 9/10 | Excellent | Creates a unique Stone minigame |
| 3 | V5 | Ramp into Action Density | 9/10 | Good | Bridges to Tempest's axis without conflict |
| 4 | V4 | Kindle Conversion | 8/10 | Moderate-Strong | Makes Kindle a decision point rather than automatic |

| 9 | V11 | The Anchor Effect | 7/10 | Perfect | Simple but unprecedented |
| 10 | V8 | Long Game Escalator | 5/10 | Perfect | Low novelty but fills a gap |
| 11 | V3 | Formation's Shield | 6/10 | Strong | Risk of being too powerful |
| 12 | V9 | Ramp into Activated Abilities | 6/10 | Excellent | Straightforward energy sink design |

---

## 7. Summary

Stone's side effects -- energy surplus, board width, Kindle concentration, Judgment volume, cost reduction density, static stacking -- create a rich substrate of unexploited game-state conditions. The most promising synergy vectors are:

1. **Judgment-count-matters** (V2) -- a novel axis that no card in the pool touches.
2. **Board positioning** (V12) -- extends Kindle's implicit position-awareness into a full minigame.
3. **Deployment storm** (V5) -- Stone reaches Tempest's "cards per turn" condition through a completely different mechanism.

These vectors can justify 5-9 new Stone cards without touching any anti-Stone mechanics (void, sacrifice, draw, fast, burst energy). They would bring Stone from 31 to 36-40 cards while enriching draft decisions in Crucible, Basalt, Depths, and Bedrock.
