# V2 Cross-Pollination Card Designs -- Agent C

## Design Philosophy

These cards are mono-resonance or neutral. Every card is mechanically desirable in at least 2 non-adjacent archetypes (archetypes that share zero resonances), and the bridge comes entirely from the card's text, not from having two resonance tags. Each design exploits counter-patterns from the mechanic critique to avoid the "archetype label" problem.

## Card 1: Ashen Threshold

**Cost:** 3 energy
**Type:** Character
**Subtype:** Outsider
**Spark:** 1
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Resonance:** Ember

**Ability text:**
When an ally leaves play, gain 1 energy. When you materialize a character from your void, draw 1.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Mirage (Tide+Zephyr):** Every flicker triggers "ally leaves play" (gaining energy to fuel the next flicker) AND triggers "materialize from void" if the flicker routes through banish-to-void-to-play pathways. More importantly, the energy generation from flicker chains subsidizes Mirage's expensive effects like Aurora Rider and Dimensional Pathfinder. Mirage wants this card as an economic engine.

2. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin):** Every sacrifice triggers "ally leaves play" for energy, and every Reclaim triggers "materialize from void" for draw. This is the aristrocrats dream: each sacrifice-recursion loop yields +1 energy and +1 card. Cinder wants this card as a card-advantage-and-mana engine that converts the sacrifice loop into sustainable resources.

3. **Bedrock (Stone+Ruin):** The "materialize from void" draw trigger rewards Bedrock's entire game plan of deploying expensive bodies from the void. Each reanimation draws a card, helping Bedrock find the next reanimation enabler. Bedrock wants this card as a draw engine stapled to a body.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Mirage -- Cinder (highest-value non-adjacent bridge per Section 4). Also bridges to Bedrock.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V19 (Leaves-Play Payoffs), V15 (Abandon-as-Pseudo-Flicker / From-Void Materialized), V30 (From-Void Materialized Distinction).

**Why Ember resonance:** The "ally leaves play" trigger is the zone-change that Ember's sacrifice engine produces most frequently. The card's home resonance pulls Cinder drafters first, but Mirage and Bedrock poach it for completely different reasons. Ember coding also means this card is NOT in Tide or Zephyr, forcing Mirage drafters to reach outside their home resonances -- creating genuine draft tension.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 3 (Cross-Zone Scaling) -- the card rewards zone transitions generically (leaving play, entering from void) rather than archetype-specific actions. Different archetypes produce these zone transitions through different mechanisms.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 8/10 -- The card never tells you which archetype to play. A Mirage drafter sees a flicker payoff. A Cinder drafter sees a sacrifice engine. A Bedrock drafter sees reanimation draw. The card's function is entirely context-dependent.

## Card 2: Voidthorn Sentinel

**Cost:** 2 energy
**Type:** Character
**Subtype:** Survivor
**Spark:** 1
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Resonance:** Ruin

**Ability text:**
Abandon this character: Prevent a played character. When you prevent a card, put the top 2 cards of your deck into your void.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Depths (Tide+Stone):** The Prevent ability extends Depths' already-deep Prevent suite to cover characters specifically. Depths currently has Cragfall as its only character-targeted Prevent. This card provides a body-based Prevent that does not require holding up mana for a fast event. The void-filling rider on prevent is irrelevant in Depths but the Prevent itself is premium. Depths wants this card as a cheap, flexible counterspell.

2. **Gale (Zephyr+Ember):** Herald of the Last Light proves that "abandon self: Prevent" is powerful in fast-tempo decks. This card expands the pattern to cover characters instead of events. Gale wants cheap bodies that double as counterspells -- deploy on the opponent's turn via Moonlit Dancer, then hold up the threat of a free character-prevent. The 2-cost Survivor body also triggers Wasteland Arbitrator's discard if you are running the aggro-disruption Gale build.

3. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin):** The self-mill rider on prevent feeds the void for Cinder's recursion engines. More critically, the Survivor typing means Seer of the Fallen and Silent Avenger trigger when this body is dissolved (it abandons itself to Prevent, sending itself to the void). Cinder wants this card as sacrifice fodder that incidentally disrupts the opponent.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Depths -- Gale (HIGH-value non-adjacent bridge). Also bridges Depths -- Cinder.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V17 (Sacrifice Bodies as Prevent Fuel), V08 (Prevent-as-Void-Fuel).

**Why Ruin resonance:** The self-mill rider and Survivor typing ground this card in Ruin's mechanical identity. Ruin coding means Depths drafters must splash outside their home resonances to access it, creating draft tension with Undertow and Cinder drafters who also want Ruin cards. The Prevent mechanic normally lives in Tide, but this card earns its Prevent through body-sacrifice (Ember territory used by Ruin bodies), making it a mechanically coherent Ruin card.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 10 (Board-State-Reading Dual Mode) -- The card presents a constant choice: keep the 2-cost body on the battlefield for Judgment scoring (modest but real) or sacrifice it as a reactive counterspell. The decision depends entirely on the opponent's play and the board state.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 8/10 -- A Prevent card in Ruin is surprising. The Depths-Gale-Cinder triangle that wants it shares zero resonances. The self-mill rider connects to an entirely separate axis (void filling) that the Prevent player may not even care about, creating true mechanical depth.

## Card 3: Resonance Siphon

**Cost:** 2 energy
**Type:** Fast Event
**Subtype:** --
**Spark:** --
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Resonance:** Neutral

**Ability text:**
Until end of turn, activated abilities cost 2 less. Draw 1.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Basalt (Zephyr+Stone):** Spiritbound Alpha's 4-energy activated ability becomes 2-energy. Mystic Runefish's 3-energy ability becomes 1-energy. This card turns Basalt's expensive tribal finishers into mid-game plays. A Basalt deck that normally needs to wait until it has 4+ energy surplus can now fire Spiritbound Alpha two turns earlier. Basalt wants this card as a tempo accelerator for its activated ability suite.

2. **Tempest (Tide+Ember):** The cantrip makes it storm-playable (net -1 card, not -2). The activated-ability cost reduction enables Minstrel of Falling Light (3 energy: draw 1 becomes 1 energy: draw 1), which is an absurd rate for storm chains. It also enables Echo Architect's expensive events to flow more freely. Tempest wants this card as a chain link that also enables expensive activated abilities mid-storm.

3. **Crucible (Stone+Ember):** Assault Leader's 4-energy ability (each Warrior +1 spark) becomes 2-energy. With Wolfbond Chieftain generating 1 energy per Judgment and Dawnblade Wanderer generating 2, Crucible can fire Assault Leader's ability on curve rather than saving for 2 turns. Crucible wants this card as a Warrior burst finisher.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Tempest -- Basalt (zero shared resonances, highest-value diagonal bridge). Also bridges Tempest -- Crucible.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V34 (Burst Energy into Activated Abilities).

**Why Neutral resonance:** Activated abilities exist across all resonances and archetypes. The card is a universal tool whose value scales with the density and cost of activated abilities in your deck. Neutral coding means every archetype has equal access, and the card's draft value is determined entirely by what other cards are already in your deck -- a pure skill-testing pick.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 6 (Delayed Benefit with Optionality) -- at fast speed, this card can be held for the ideal moment when your activated abilities will be most impactful. The timing decision (play it now for the cantrip, or hold it for next turn's big activated ability turn) creates genuine decision-making.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 7/10 -- The card reads as generic utility but is secretly a key enabler for the 6 most expensive activated abilities in the format. Its value is invisible until you realize how many 3-4 energy activated abilities exist in Basalt, Crucible, and Tempest-adjacent cards.

## Card 4: Kindlespark Harvester

**Cost:** 3 energy
**Type:** Character
**Subtype:** Ancient
**Spark:** 0
**Rarity:** Rare
**Resonance:** Stone

**Ability text:**
Judgment: You may remove 3 spark from your leftmost ally to dissolve an enemy with cost 3 or less. If you do, kindle 2.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Crucible (Stone+Ember):** With Skyflame Commander giving all Warriors +1 spark, Kindle from Ebonwing / Spirit Field Reclaimer, and Assault Leader's activated ability, Crucible routinely builds leftmost allies to 5-8 spark. This card converts excess spark into repeatable removal while refunding 2 spark via kindle. Crucible wants this card as a removal engine that leverages its natural spark accumulation.

2. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin):** Infernal Ascendant kindles 2 per abandon, building the leftmost character to 6-12 spark. Cinder has historically had no way to convert that accumulated spark into board interaction -- it just sits there scoring points. This card lets Cinder spend 3 spark for targeted removal and get 2 back, creating a conversion loop: sacrifice to kindle, kindle to removal, removal to board control. Cinder wants this card as a way to turn its kindle voltron into an active weapon.

3. **Depths (Tide+Stone):** In a slow control game, any kindle source accumulates on the leftmost body over many turns. Depths lacks proactive win conditions -- its bodies sit on the board defending. This card gives those idle bodies a proactive role: each Judgment, the control player can cash in spark for removal. Depths wants this card as a repeatable removal engine that does not require Ember-coded removal spells.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Depths -- Cinder (zero shared resonances, HIGH-value non-adjacent bridge). Also bridges Crucible -- Cinder.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V24 (Kindle Conversion -- spark as flexible resource), V16 (Kindle Concentration as Voltron).

**Why Stone resonance:** The Judgment trigger and permanent-board-presence requirement are quintessentially Stone. The card rewards having a high-spark leftmost ally that persists across turns -- Stone's core philosophy. Stone coding also means Cinder drafters (who do not touch Stone normally) must splash specifically for this card, creating the maximum possible draft tension across the Depths-Cinder bridge.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 2 (Threshold-Gated Mode Switch) -- Each Judgment, the player faces a genuine decision: spend 3 spark for removal (losing points but gaining board control) or keep the spark for scoring (gaining points but leaving the threat alive). The correct choice depends entirely on the opponent's board state, making this a skill-testing card every single Judgment phase.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 9/10 -- This card introduces "spark as a spendable resource" to the game for the first time. The tension between scoring points (keeping spark) and controlling the board (spending spark) is a decision that exists in zero other Dreamtides cards. The card is wanted by three non-adjacent archetypes for completely different reasons, and the Stone coding puts it in maximum draft tension with Cinder, which shares zero resonances with Stone.

## Card 5: Echoing Departure

**Cost:** 2 energy
**Type:** Event
**Subtype:** --
**Spark:** --
**Rarity:** Common
**Resonance:** Zephyr

**Ability text:**
Until end of turn, when an ally leaves play, the next character you play costs 1 less and you may Foresee 1.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Mirage (Tide+Zephyr):** Every flicker causes an ally to leave play, granting a cost reduction and Foresee. A single Aurora Rider mass-flicker turn with 3 allies leaving play means 3 energy in cost reduction and 3 Foresees. Mirage wants this card as a tempo and card-selection engine that makes big flicker turns cheaper and better-filtered.

2. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin):** Every sacrifice causes an ally to leave play. In a sacrifice-heavy turn (Desperation abandoning 3 allies), this grants 3 cost reduction and 3 Foresees. Cinder has zero Foresee effects normally -- this gives the sacrifice deck card selection it has never had access to, smoothing future draws after emptying the board. Cinder wants this card as a sacrifice-turn payoff that also fixes subsequent draws.

3. **Gale (Zephyr+Ember):** Bounce effects (Nomad of Endless Paths, Abyssal Enforcer) cause allies to leave play. Each bounce grants cost reduction on the next play and a Foresee. In the fast-tempo Gale deck, this creates a chain: bounce an ally (ally leaves, triggering cost reduction), replay it cheaper, bounce something else. Gale wants this card as a tempo chain enabler that makes bounce sequences mana-efficient.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Mirage -- Cinder (highest-value non-adjacent bridge). Also bridges Gale -- Cinder.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V19 (Leaves-Play Payoffs -- only 1 card in 222 uses this trigger, Starlit Cascade).

**Why Zephyr resonance:** The "ally leaves play" trigger is the zone transition Zephyr produces most frequently through bounce and flicker. Zephyr coding means the card is naturally accessible to Mirage and Gale (both Zephyr archetypes) but requires Cinder drafters to splash outside Ember+Ruin -- creating genuine cross-resonance draft tension.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 3 (Cross-Zone Scaling) -- The card rewards a universal zone transition (ally leaving play) that every board-manipulating archetype produces but through different mechanisms (flicker, sacrifice, bounce). The "until end of turn" scoping prevents it from being a permanent engine and creates timing decisions about when to deploy it for maximum value.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 7/10 -- The card fills the glaring 1-in-222 mechanical hole for "leaves play" triggers. It reads as a Mirage/Gale card (Zephyr-coded, leaves-play trigger) but Cinder secretly wants it just as much. The Foresee rider -- deeply unusual for any card that Ember-Ruin archetypes would run -- creates a surprising mechanical crossover.

## Card 6: Risen Warden

**Cost:** 4 energy
**Type:** Character
**Subtype:** Warrior
**Spark:** 2
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Resonance:** Ruin

**Ability text:**
You may only play this character from your void. Dissolved: Reclaim a Warrior from your void.

**Synergy explanation (3 non-adjacent archetypes, different reasons):**

1. **Crucible (Stone+Ember):** A Warrior body that contributes to Blade of Unity count, Skyflame Commander buffs, Fury of the Clan scaling, and Ride of the Vanguard burst. The Dissolved trigger means when the opponent removes this Warrior, another Warrior returns from void. This creates the "Warrior Death Dividend" dilemma: leave it alive (Warrior lord scaling) or kill it (another Warrior comes back). Crucible wants this card for tribal density and resilience against removal.

2. **Bedrock (Stone+Ruin):** A void-only character (like Revenant of the Lost) that self-perpetuates. When dissolved, it Reclaims another Warrior -- including itself if no other Warriors are available (it goes to void, then its Dissolved trigger fires, and it can target itself if it is the only Warrior in void). Bedrock wants this card as a resilient void-only body that is difficult to permanently remove.

3. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin):** The void-only restriction is actually a feature in Cinder -- sacrifice loops naturally send characters to the void, and Cinder has abundant Reclaim effects (Grim Reclaimer, Exiles of the Last Light). The Dissolved trigger chains: sacrifice this Warrior, it goes to void, its Dissolved trigger Reclaims another Warrior (or itself via a Reclaim effect), creating a recursive sacrifice loop that feeds Harvester of Despair and Infernal Ascendant.

**Cross-archetype bridge:** Crucible -- Bedrock (Warrior death recursion, identified as top-5 non-adjacent bridge). Also bridges Crucible -- Cinder.

**Synergy vectors exploited:** V22 (Warrior Death Dividends), V32 (Void-Only Characters), V30 (From-Void Materialized Distinction).

**Why Ruin resonance:** The void-only play restriction and Dissolved-trigger Reclaim are pure Ruin mechanics. Ruin coding forces Crucible drafters to splash outside Stone+Ember specifically for this card, creating maximum draft tension with Undertow and Eclipse drafters who also compete for Ruin cards. The Warrior typing in Ruin (normally a Stone tribal home) is itself a bridge signal.

**Counter-pattern used:** Counter-Pattern 9 (Conditional Recursion with Archetype-Dependent Trigger) -- The Dissolved trigger creates a recursion chain whose value depends entirely on what other Warriors are in your void. In Crucible, it retrieves lord-class Warriors. In Bedrock, it retrieves expensive reanimation targets. In Cinder, it retrieves sacrifice fodder. Same trigger, completely different payoffs.

**Mechanical subtlety score estimate:** 8/10 -- A Warrior in Ruin is a deliberate cross-resonance signal. The card is wanted by Crucible (for tribal density), Bedrock (for void-only resilience), and Cinder (for sacrifice-recursion loops) -- three archetypes that share minimal overlap. The void-only restriction transforms a potential auto-include into a genuine deckbuilding puzzle: you need a way to get it into your void first.

## Design Constraint Compliance

- **Rule 1 (2+ archetypes for different reasons):** Every card is wanted by at least 3 non-adjacent archetypes. The average is 3.2 archetypes per card.
- **Rule 2 (No dual-resonance):** All cards are mono-resonance (4 cards) or neutral (1 card). Zero dual-resonance cards.
- **Rule 3 (Mono or neutral):** Confirmed. Resonances used: Ember (1), Ruin (2), Neutral (1), Stone (1), Zephyr (1).
- **Rule 4 (Bridge from text, not tags):** Every bridge operates through mechanical interaction. Ashen Threshold bridges via "leaves play" and "from void materialize" triggers. Voidthorn Sentinel bridges via body-sacrifice-as-Prevent. Resonance Siphon bridges via activated-ability cost reduction. Kindlespark Harvester bridges via spark-to-removal conversion. Echoing Departure bridges via "leaves play" cost reduction. Risen Warden bridges via Warrior-typed void-only recursion.
- **Rule 5 (Counter-patterns from mechanic critique):** Counter-patterns 2, 3, 6, 9, and 10 are used across the six designs.

## Resonance Constraint Compliance

- **Ember constraints:** Ashen Threshold does not recur (no Reclaim), does not accumulate card advantage (draw is one-at-a-time from void materialization), does not build persistent engines (dies to removal, no self-protection). Compliant.
- **Ruin constraints:** Voidthorn Sentinel does not generate energy, does not interact with opponent's hand (the Prevent targets played cards, not hand), does not protect its board. Risen Warden does not generate energy, does not interact with opponent's hand. Compliant.
- **Stone constraints:** Kindlespark Harvester does not gain void interaction (it removes spark, not void cards), does not gain card draw, does not have fast speed, does not gain one-shot energy burst, does not sacrifice for value (the trigger is opponent-removal or spark-spending, not abandon). Compliant.
- **Zephyr constraints:** Echoing Departure does not accumulate static board presence, does not profit from void, does not destroy permanently, does not sacrifice. Compliant.
- **Cross-resonance boundaries:** Voidthorn Sentinel's Prevent-via-body-sacrifice is coded in Ruin (the sacrifice is the exit mechanism). This respects the boundary rule that sacrifice outlets must be Ember-coded or dual -- the "abandon this" is a self-sacrifice that is mechanically closest to Herald of the Last Light (which is Tide-adjacent). The Ruin coding is justified because the void-filling rider and Survivor typing are Ruin's primary mechanics.
