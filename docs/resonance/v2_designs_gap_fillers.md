# V2 Gap Filler Card Designs -- Agent E

## Design Philosophy

These 5 cards address the remaining structural holes identified in the synergy map (Section 6, Agent E) that Agents A-D do not cover. Each card is designed as a "hidden gem" -- a card that a first-time drafter would evaluate as generically decent, not recognizing its explosive synergy in 2-3 specific archetypes until they have played several drafts. Every card is mono-resonance (no duals -- Agent A handles those). Every card is good in at least 2 archetypes for mechanically distinct reasons.

Counter-patterns from the mechanic critique are referenced where applied.

## Card 1: Ironbark Sentinel

**Gap filled:** Crucible purity-vs-power tension (V27 Anchor Effect + V03 Board Width)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Ironbark Sentinel |
| **Cost** | 4 energy |
| **Type** | Character |
| **Subtype** | Ancient |
| **Spark** | 3 |
| **Rarity** | Rare |
| **Resonance** | Stone |

**Ability text:**
Judgment: Each ally that has been on the battlefield since your last turn gains +1 spark until end of turn.

**Synergy explanation:**

1. **Crucible (Stone+Ember) -- the intended "purity breaker":** This is the single most important card for reducing Crucible's 9/10 rails score. At 4 cost, 3 spark, Ancient subtype, Ironbark Sentinel is individually more powerful than any Warrior in the pool -- Skyflame Commander is 2/1, Company Commander is 2/0, Blade of Unity scales but starts low. Ironbark Sentinel is a 4/3 that gives +1 spark to every surviving ally each Judgment. In a Crucible deck with 4-5 Warriors that persist across turns, this is +4-5 temporary spark per Judgment, rivaling Skyflame Commander's static +1. But it is NOT a Warrior. Every copy of Ironbark Sentinel in a Crucible deck is one fewer Warrior for Blade of Unity's count, one fewer target for Summons of the Bonded, one fewer body that Skyflame Commander buffs. This creates the "purity vs. power" tension the drafter critique demanded: do you keep your Warrior density pure for lord synergy, or do you dilute with a generically more powerful card?

2. **Depths (Tide+Stone) -- control finisher:** Depths builds a persistent board of control bodies (Pallid Arbiter, Cloaked Sentinel, Paradox Enforcer, Riftwalker) that stay in play for many turns while opponents struggle to deploy through tax effects and Prevents. These bodies typically have 1-2 spark -- negligible Judgment scoring. Ironbark Sentinel transforms every surviving control body into a growing threat. Paradox Enforcer (2 spark) becomes 3, then 4, then 5 across consecutive Judgments, giving Depths a proactive win condition that emerges naturally from the control game plan without requiring any new cards. This addresses the Depths gap of "lacks a proactive finisher axis."

3. **Basalt (Zephyr+Stone) -- the anti-synergy trap:** A first-time drafter might put this in Basalt, expecting it to pump Spirit Animals. But Basalt's Zephyr half constantly flickers creatures off the battlefield and back -- resetting the "has been on the battlefield since your last turn" check. Ironbark Sentinel actively punishes flicker, creating a clean anti-synergy with Zephyr that reinforces resonance separation. A Basalt drafter who takes this card will discover the tension and learn something about the game's architecture.

**Why a first-time drafter wouldn't see the synergy:**

A new drafter sees "4 cost, 3 spark, Ancient" and thinks "generic big body." The Judgment text looks like a modest incremental bonus -- +1 spark per ally doesn't sound game-breaking. They won't immediately calculate that in a board of 5 Warriors that have persisted 2 turns, this is +5 spark every Judgment on top of lord buffs. They also won't immediately see the purity tension with Crucible's Warrior density. The card looks boring. It is not. The "has been on the battlefield since your last turn" condition is completely unprecedented in the 222-card pool (zero cards use continuous-presence tracking), so drafters have no mental model for evaluating it.

## Card 2: Tidechannel Observer

**Gap filled:** Undertow differentiation (V29 Void Velocity -- non-Survivor void payoff)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Tidechannel Observer |
| **Cost** | 3 energy |
| **Type** | Character |
| **Subtype** | Ancient |
| **Spark** | 1 |
| **Rarity** | Uncommon |
| **Resonance** | Ruin |

**Ability text:**
Judgment: If 3 or more cards entered your void this turn, gain 2 points and kindle 1.

**Synergy explanation:**

1. **Undertow (Tide+Ruin) -- the slot competitor:** This card is deliberately designed to compete with Survivor tribal slots in Undertow. Undertow's 12 auto-includes (the deckbuilder critique's worst offender after Crucible's 16) make the archetype build itself. Tidechannel Observer is a non-Survivor, mono-Ruin card that rewards exactly what Undertow does -- filling the void rapidly -- but on an Ancient body that does not benefit from Soulkindler's +2 spark, does not trigger Flagbearer of Decay's mill, and does not count for Hope's Vanguard's Survivor threshold. Including it means cutting a Survivor, diluting the tribal density that makes the other 11 auto-includes powerful. This is the tension the deckbuilder critique asked for: a non-Survivor void payoff that competes for deck slots and forces an actual decision about how many Survivors is enough.

   The void velocity trigger (3+ cards entering void this turn) differentiates Undertow from Bedrock. Undertow mills 4-8 cards per turn through Flagbearer of Decay, Searcher in the Mists, and Ashborn Necromancer -- easily hitting the 3-card threshold. Bedrock fills its void slowly (1-2 cards per turn via Entomb or targeted discard), almost never reaching 3 in a single turn. This means Tidechannel Observer is functionally unplayable in Bedrock while being excellent in Undertow, reducing the Ruin bottleneck competition.

2. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin) -- sacrifice velocity:** Cinder's sacrifice chains send 2-3 characters to the void per turn through abandon effects. On a big sacrifice turn with Desperation or Obliterator of Worlds, 3+ cards easily enter the void. Tidechannel Observer gives Cinder a passive scoring engine that rewards the velocity of sacrifice without requiring any specific Survivor density. The kindle rider is particularly strong in Cinder because Infernal Ascendant and Exiles of the Last Light are already building a kindle tower -- Tidechannel Observer adds to that tower for free while also scoring points.

3. **Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) -- discard velocity:** Eclipse's discard engines (Fragments of Vision: discard 2, Urban Cipher: discard 2, Evacuation Enforcer: discard 3) regularly put 3+ cards into the void from hand. Tidechannel Observer rewards this behavior with points and kindle, giving Eclipse an alternative scoring axis beyond Apocalypse Vigilante's per-discard points.

**Why a first-time drafter wouldn't see the synergy:**

The card looks like a worse Abomination of Memory (which scales with total void size, not velocity). "Gain 2 points and kindle 1" sounds like a modest payoff for a condition that seems hard to hit. A new drafter thinks "3 cards into my void in one turn? That seems rare." They don't realize that Undertow, Cinder, and Eclipse all regularly exceed this threshold as a baseline part of their game plan. The void velocity axis (V29) is completely invisible in the existing card pool -- zero cards measure the rate of void-filling rather than the total void size. Drafters who understand the distinction between velocity and volume are the ones who will find this card.

## Card 3: Fading Resonant

**Gap filled:** "Leaves play" payoffs (V19 -- only 1 of 222 cards uses this trigger)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Fading Resonant |
| **Cost** | 2 energy |
| **Type** | Character |
| **Subtype** | Visitor |
| **Spark** | 1 |
| **Rarity** | Uncommon |
| **Resonance** | Zephyr |

**Ability text:**
When an ally leaves play, the next character you play this turn costs 1 less.

**Synergy explanation:**

This card fills one of the most glaring mechanical holes in the 222-card pool. Only Starlit Cascade ("when ally leaves play, gain 2 energy") triggers on allies leaving play. This is Zephyr's single most frequent zone change -- bounce, flicker, opponent removal, sacrifice -- and it is virtually unmonitored. Fading Resonant addresses this by converting each "leave play" event into a cost reduction, enabling tempo plays that chain deployments.

1. **Mirage (Tide+Zephyr) -- flicker tempo engine:** Every flicker is a "leave play" event (the character is banished, i.e. leaves play, then re-materializes). Flickerveil Adept's Judgment trigger, Blooming Path Wanderer, Starlight Guide, Portal of Twin Paths -- each one triggers Fading Resonant's cost reduction. In a typical Mirage flicker turn, 2-3 allies leave play, generating 2-3 cost reductions. This lets Mirage chain materializations: flicker an ally (leaves play, cost -1), use the discount to play a cheap character from hand, that character's Materialized trigger fires, then you can flicker again. The card transforms Mirage from a "flicker for value" deck into a "flicker for tempo" deck, creating the Tempo Mirage build variant that the deckbuilder critique identified as wanting support.

2. **Gale (Zephyr+Ember) -- bounce-deploy tempo:** Gale's bounce effects (Nomad of Endless Paths, Abyssal Enforcer, Return to Nowhere, Ethereal Courser) return allies to hand -- each one a "leave play" event. Herald of the Last Light abandons itself to Prevent -- another "leave play." Each trigger makes the next fast character cheaper to deploy, enabling the rapid-deployment tempo that Gale's Musician trio rewards. In a Gale deck with Sage of the Prelude and Intermezzo Balladeer on board, Fading Resonant converts every bounce into a cheaper fast play, which in turn triggers the Musicians. This is a Gale enabler that looks nothing like a Gale card.

3. **Cinder (Ember+Ruin) -- sacrifice chaining:** Every abandon is a "leave play" event. In a Cinder sacrifice turn, you abandon 2-3 allies, each one reducing the cost of the next character you play. This lets Cinder deploy sacrifice fodder more efficiently between sacrifice chains. Resilient Wanderer (Dissolved: pay 1 to return to hand) becomes a 1-cost deploy after the first sacrifice triggers a discount, enabling tighter sacrifice loops.

**Why a first-time drafter wouldn't see the synergy:**

Fading Resonant looks like a marginal tempo card. "When an ally leaves play" sounds like it triggers on your creatures dying -- a bad thing. A new drafter thinks "why would I want my allies to leave play?" They don't immediately connect it to flicker (where allies leave and return), to bounce (intentionally returning allies), or to sacrifice (deliberate departure). The Visitor subtype gives no tribal signals. The 2-cost, 1-spark body looks unimpressive. Only a drafter who understands that Mirage, Gale, and Cinder all generate "ally leaves play" events as a routine part of their game plan will recognize this as a build-around tempo engine. The card rewards system mastery -- understanding Dreamtides' zone-change patterns -- rather than obvious synergy reading.

## Card 4: Stormtrace Augur

**Gap filled:** Tempest variety (V06 Event-Count-in-Void -- non-event-count storm triggers)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Stormtrace Augur |
| **Cost** | 3 energy |
| **Type** | Character |
| **Subtype** | Mage |
| **Spark** | 0 |
| **Rarity** | Rare |
| **Resonance** | Tide |

**Ability text:**
This character's spark is equal to the number of events in your void.

**Synergy explanation:**

The mechanic critique identified that 4 of 5 new Tempest cards use the identical "2+ events this turn" trigger, creating mechanical monotony. Stormtrace Augur provides a fundamentally different Tempest scaling axis: cumulative event history rather than single-turn event density. This is V06 (Event-Count-in-Void) executed as a Tide-coded character rather than a Tide+Ember dual, making it a mono-resonance hidden gem rather than an obvious Tempest signpost.

1. **Tempest (Tide+Ember) -- late-game scaling finisher:** Tempest plays 8-15 events per game, all of which go to the void after resolving. By the mid-to-late game, a Tempest player has 6-10 events in their void. Stormtrace Augur is a 3-cost body with 6-10 spark -- exceeding The Devourer (8/8 for 8 cost) in spark-per-energy efficiency. But unlike Spirit of Smoldering Echoes (which gains +1 spark per event entering void during the game), Stormtrace Augur checks the current void count at Judgment, meaning void-hate effects (Soulflame Predator, Spirit Field Reclaimer) can shrink it. This creates counterplay that Spirit of Smoldering Echoes lacks. The critical distinction from the "2+ events this turn" trigger is that Stormtrace Augur rewards cumulative event play across the game, not explosive single turns. A Chain Tempest build (the deckbuilder critique's second Tempest variant) that plays 2-3 events per turn over 5 turns values this card much more than Big Storm Tempest.

2. **Depths (Tide+Stone) -- control finisher via Prevent accumulation:** This is the hidden synergy. Depths plays 5-7 Prevent events per game. Every Prevent event goes to the void after resolving. A Depths player who has cast 5 Prevents has 5 events in their void, making Stormtrace Augur a 3-cost, 5-spark body -- the most efficient finisher in the Depths pool. No other Depths finisher reaches 5 spark for 3 energy. The card transforms Depths' reactive Prevent game into a proactive scoring threat: every counter you cast makes your finisher bigger. This gives Depths the proactive win condition that emerges naturally from the control game plan, addressing the gap analysis's finding that Depths "lacks a proactive finisher axis."

3. **Eclipse (Zephyr+Ruin) -- void-counting via discarded events:** Eclipse's draw-discard cycling puts events into the void alongside characters. A New Adventure, Moonlit Voyage, Fragments of Vision, Skies of Change -- all are events that go to the void after use, and Eclipse also discards events from hand to void. By mid-game, Eclipse has 4-6 events in the void, making Stormtrace Augur a respectable 4-6 spark body for 3 energy. This is a void-counting payoff that does not require Ruin coding (it is mono-Tide), giving Eclipse access through its Tide-accessible secondary resonance via draft flexibility.

**Why a first-time drafter wouldn't see the synergy:**

A new drafter reads "spark equals events in your void" and thinks "I need to build around self-mill." They associate void-filling with Undertow, not Tempest. They don't realize that Tempest's normal game plan of playing events (which resolve to the void) naturally fills the void with events as a byproduct. The card looks like it wants a dedicated self-mill deck, but it secretly rewards any deck that plays lots of events -- which is what Tempest and Depths already do. The Mage subtype and Tide resonance give no Tempest signals. The 0 starting spark makes it look terrible until you count the events in your void and realize it is the cheapest high-spark body in the format. The conflation between "void count" (Ruin territory) and "event-specific void count" (Tide territory) is the subtlety that makes this card invisible to inexperienced drafters. At subtlety 9/10 per the synergy map, this is precisely the kind of distinction that separates good drafters from great ones.

## Card 5: Duskwatch Warden

**Gap filled:** Free-Prevent tempo card (Gale/Depths bridge + V17 Sacrifice as Prevent)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Duskwatch Warden |
| **Cost** | 2 energy |
| **Type** | Character |
| **Subtype** | Outsider |
| **Spark** | 2 |
| **Rarity** | Uncommon |
| **Resonance** | Tide |

**Ability text:**
When you prevent a card, your next event this turn costs 2 less.

**Synergy explanation:**

This card bridges the gap between reactive denial (Prevent) and proactive tempo, addressing two specific gaps: the Gale/Depths bridge (non-adjacent archetype pair #2 in the cross-archetype bridge map) and the absence of Prevent-trigger payoffs (V02). Unlike the V02 signpost dual proposed for Agent A (which directly rewards Preventing with energy and kindle), Duskwatch Warden converts Prevents into tempo -- cost reduction on your next event -- creating a fundamentally different play pattern that bridges control and aggression.

1. **Depths (Tide+Stone) -- Prevent tempo conversion:** Depths holds up 2-3 energy for Prevent effects and often wastes it when the opponent plays around the counter. Duskwatch Warden converts successful Prevents into tempo: after Preventing a card with Abolish (2 energy), your next event costs 2 less, effectively refunding the Prevent's cost. This lets Depths play Prevent-then-develop in the same turn cycle, addressing the "unspent energy at end of turn" problem (V05) from a different angle. The card makes Depths' reactive game plan feel proactive: you counter their play, then slam a discounted finisher or draw spell. The 2-cost, 2-spark body is also a solid early blocker that Depths wants for board presence.

2. **Gale (Zephyr+Ember) -- fast Prevent chaining:** This is the hidden gem. Gale plays fast Prevent events (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance, Infernal Rest) to trigger Musician payoffs -- each Prevent is a fast card that triggers Sage of the Prelude's draw, Intermezzo Balladeer's spark growth, and Melodist of the Finale's points. Duskwatch Warden adds a second reward layer: after Preventing, the next event (another fast Prevent, or Immolate, or Dreamscatter) costs 2 less. This creates chains: Prevent (triggers Musicians + Duskwatch Warden), then play a discounted fast removal or draw spell (triggers Musicians again). The card bridges Gale's fast-tempo identity to Depths' Prevent suite, making 2-3 splash Prevents in Gale significantly more powerful. This addresses the non-adjacent bridge gap between Depths and Gale identified as the #2 highest-value bridge.

3. **Tempest (Tide+Ember) -- storm chain insurance:** Tempest splashes 1-2 Prevents (Abolish, Ripple of Defiance) as protection against the opponent disrupting their storm turn. Duskwatch Warden turns defensive Prevents into storm fuel: counter the opponent's disruption, then play your next event for 2 less energy, extending the chain. In a Tempest deck running Starcatcher ("when you play an event, gain 1 energy"), a Prevented card + Duskwatch Warden's discount + Starcatcher's energy gain creates a net-positive interaction: you counter the opponent, gain 1 energy from Starcatcher (the Prevent is an event played), and get 2 off your next event. The card makes defensive Prevents into offensive tempo plays.

**Why a first-time drafter wouldn't see the synergy:**

Duskwatch Warden looks like a narrow Depths card. "When you prevent a card" sounds like it requires a control deck with many Prevents -- boring, defensive, and clearly Depths-coded. A new drafter would never put it in Gale or Tempest because those archetypes are not associated with Preventing. They don't realize that Gale already runs 2-3 fast Prevents to trigger Musicians, and that adding Duskwatch Warden converts those splash Prevents into a tempo engine. The Outsider subtype gives no tribal signals. The 2-cost, 2-spark body looks like filler. The card's power is invisible until you recognize that Prevents are events, events trigger event-matters payoffs, and cost reduction enables chains -- a three-step logical chain that requires understanding of how Gale, Depths, and Tempest each interact with Prevent effects differently.

## Notes on Gaps Not Addressed

The synergy map assigned 6 gaps to Agent E. This document addresses 5 of them (combining the Crucible purity-vs-power and Tempest variety gaps into focused single-card solutions, and folding the hand-size body into Agent A's dual signpost work per the synergy map's own recommendation in slot 5 for Agent E). The hand-size body for Mirage (V01 on a Zephyr body) is deferred to Agent A's Depths signpost work, which already creates a hand-size-matters axis that Mirage can access through Tide-coded cards. Adding a second hand-size card as a mono-Zephyr gap filler would risk over-saturating the axis before it is proven in play.

The free-Prevent card in the synergy map's Agent E slot 6 ("Your next Prevent event this turn costs 0") was redesigned as Duskwatch Warden, which achieves the same tempo objective (making Prevents net-free in mana) through a more mechanically subtle mechanism (cost reduction on the NEXT event after a Prevent, rather than directly reducing Prevent costs). This creates a broader play pattern (the discount applies to any event, not just Prevents) while still enabling the intended Gale/Depths bridge.
