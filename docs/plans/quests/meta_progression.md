# Quest Meta Progression

Meta progression in dreamtides quests is an "achievement-based" system. Each
meta progression reward is defined in TOML with an associated trigger condition
like "win 3 quests", "win a quest with only Ember cards", "play 500 events",
etc.

Early meta progression rewards are intentionally very linear and serve as a
"tutorial" to the game, unlocking new functionality. These early rewards are all
just tied to "number of quests attempted", where "attempted" means the user
started at least one battle.

Examples of meta progression rewards are:

- Unlocking cards from a different resonance pool (at the start only Ember and
  Tide are unlocked)
- Unlocking the ability to mulligan in battles and get a new opening hand
- Increasing starting energy in battles
- Increasing starting hand size in battles
- Unlocking additional Dreamcallers
- Causing the first Dreamscape to be generated without a battle, letting the
  player refine their deck more before running a battle
- Adding an additional Dreamcaller to the Dreamcaller Draft
- Unlocking each of the enhanced sites
- Allowing the player to lose one battle and continue the quest
- Increasing starting essence
- Gaining the ability to reroll a certain number of draft picks
- Generating more dreamscapes during Dream Atlas generation
- Unlocking certain rare cards to appear in the draft pool
- Unlocking certain rare dreamsigns to appear in quests
- Cosmetic modifications to cards or dreamsigns
