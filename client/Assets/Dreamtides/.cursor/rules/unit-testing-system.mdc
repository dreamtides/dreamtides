# Unit Testing System

We ONLY use Editor-mode Unity tests in this project.

## DreamtidesUnitTest Base Class

All unit tests extend `DreamtidesUnitTest`. Key methods:

- `Initialize(IGameViewport?)` - Sets up Registry with generated scene objects
- `CreateViewport(GameViewResolution)` - Creates a `FakeViewport` for testing
- `CreateViewportForLandscapeLayout(resolution, battleLayoutYRotation?)` - Creates
  viewport matching the landscape layout's camera position
- `CreateTestCard()` / `CreateTestCards(count)` - Creates test card objects
- `CreateSceneObject<T>()` - Creates and initializes a Displayable

Tests are `[UnityTest]` coroutines that `yield return Initialize(viewport)`.


## IGameViewport Abstraction

**Always use `Registry.GameViewport` instead of directly accessing Camera,
Screen, or Canvas.** This enables testing different screen resolutions.

`IGameViewport` methods:
- `WorldToViewportPoint()`, `WorldToScreenPoint()`, `ScreenToWorldPoint()`
- `ScreenWidth`, `ScreenHeight`, `IsLandscape`
- `SafeAreaMinimumAnchor`, `SafeAreaMaximumAnchor` (for device notches)

Production uses `RealViewport` (wraps real Camera). Tests use `FakeViewport`
which simulates camera projection mathematically.


## Testing Different Resolutions

Use `GameViewResolution` enum for common aspect ratios:
- `Resolution16x9` - 82% of Steam users (1920x1080)
- `Resolution21x9` - Ultrawide monitors
- `Resolution16x10`, `Resolution3x2`, `Resolution5x4` - Various displays
- `ResolutionIPhone12`, `ResolutionIPadPro12`, etc. - Mobile devices

Test the same behavior across resolutions to catch layout edge cases. Make sure
things are fully on-screen.


## Testing Battle Layout Y Rotation

The battle layout can be rotated (for visual variety). Test that cards remain
visible at different rotations using `battleLayoutYRotation` parameter:

```csharp
viewport = CreateViewportForLandscapeLayout(
    GameViewResolution.Resolution16x9,
    battleLayoutYRotation: 120f
);
```

Test at 0°, 90°, 120°, 180°, 270° to ensure layouts work at all angles.


## Generated Scene Code

Tests use auto-generated classes that create minimal scene hierarchies:
- `GeneratedRegistry` - Creates Registry with fake services
- `GeneratedLandscapeBattleLayout` / `GeneratedPortraitBattleLayout`
- `GeneratedCanvas`, `GeneratedMainCamera`, `GeneratedSites`

These are regenerated via Editor menu when scene structure changes.


## Best Practices

1. Create viewport BEFORE `Initialize()` to set screen dimensions
2. Use that viewport again AFTER `Initialize()` using layout's camera position
3. Use `AssertCardIsOnScreen(viewport, card)` to verify visibility
4. Use `AssertCardsAreHorizontallyOrdered(viewport, cards)` for ordering
5. Test multiple card counts (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15) to catch scaling issues
6. Run tests via `just unity-test-rsync` from command line
