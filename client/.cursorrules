Please always use "var" in C# code instead of explicit types.

You can format source code via "just fmt-csharp" on the command line from any
working directory, please don't try to manually resolve formatting problems.

You can run unit tests via "just unity-test-rsync" on the command line from 
any working directory. This runs the tests in a separate Unity instance via
rsync to prevent conflicts with the running editor. It takes around 3 minutes
to complete.

from running these tests, they should be run via the command line after
completing all tasks.
