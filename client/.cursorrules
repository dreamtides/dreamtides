Please begin every response with "Sure!".

Please DO NOT include any comments in generated source code.

Please put public methods at the top of files, then protected,
then private. Private member *fields* & serialized fields
always go at the top.

Please always use "var" in C# code instead of explicit types.

Do not run "just review" after making client changes.

Code should not directly access the camera, screen bounds, or canvas rect. Instead,
please use Registry.GameViewport to get an IGameViewport instance which abstracts
out this information.

You can format source code via "just fmt-csharp" on the command line from any
working directory, please don't try to manually resolve formatting problems.

You can run unit tests via "just unity-test-rsync" on the command line from 
any working directory. This runs the tests in a separate Unity instance via
rsync to prevent conflicts with the running editor. It takes around 3 minutes
to complete.

Test output is written to ~/dreamtides_tests/client/test_output/results.xml,
although this is a very large file and will likely need to be searcehd via
grep or similar tools

You can typically find output for a single test via a command like

```
grep -A 15 'test-case.*name="ScaleReducesAtPortraitThreshold"' ~/dreamtides_tests/client/test_output/results.xml
```

It is NOT TRUE that "Unity play-mode tests require the editor" prevents you
from running these tests, they should be run via the command line after
completing all tasks.

When creating tests, please modify any serialized fields you need to be 
"internal" and then add [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Dreamtides.Tests")],
do not attempt to set them via reflection.

When writing tests, put the tests at the top of the file and helpers as
private elements at the bottom of the file.

Please do not use reflection in unit tests. Instead, follow the pattern of
adding "internal" to methods we need to call

Please include argument labels for integer and booleans literals when invoking
methods. Example: CreateTestLayout(horizontalSpacing: 12.0, forceTwoRows: false).
Labels are not required when passing variables.
